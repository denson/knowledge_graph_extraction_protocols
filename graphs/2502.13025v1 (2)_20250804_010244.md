## ABSTRACT

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multiagent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond 80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.

## Introduction $\mathbf 1$

From Newton's laws to the discovery of DNA, science has long depended on human intuition, trial-and-error, and incremental experimentation. The 20th century saw the rise of computational modeling and automated data analysis, accelerating discovery but keeping humans at the core of the process. The advent of deep learning in the 2010s enabled machines to recognize complex patterns, but these systems remained tethered to their training distributions  $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ . Most contemporary AI systems excel at statistical generalization within their training distribution, but they rarely generate or validate hypotheses that reach beyond it.

# Sparks: Artificial Intelligence Discovers Protein Design Principles

Scientific discovery, however, demands more than pattern recognition; it requires agency of competing interests that can propose, test, and revise ideas until a falsifiable, general law emerges [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. We show that this capability arises when large foundation models are organized into an adversarial, taskspecialized generation-reflection architecture: each proposer—charged with formulating a hypothesis, writing code, collecting new physics data from simulation, or interpreting data—is paired with an isomorphic critic that immediately interrogates the output, driving exploration into regions where their priors diverge. This adversarial loop pushes the search beyond the models' training distribution and enables the synthesis of genuinely novel knowledge. We instantiate the concept in protein science, an arena where the combinatorial space of sequences, structures, and mechanics has long defied exhaustive human exploration [13, 14, 15, 16].

It also shows a system diagram with biological, industrial, and artistic components. Diagram "b" illustrates an automated hypothesis generation and validation process. It includes model inputs such as user queries, tools, and constraints. The process is divided into four stages: research idea generation, testing, refinement, and documentation, leading to a final document.

Figure 1: Overview of Sparks, a multi-agent AI model for automated scientific discovery. Panel a: Contemporary AI systems excel at statistical generalization within known domains, but rarely generate or validate hypotheses that extend beyond prior data, and cannot typically identify shared principles across distinct phenomena. This is because powerful models tend to memorize physics without discovering shared concepts. For scientific discovery, however, the elucidation of more general and shared foundational concepts (such as a scaling law, design principle, or crossover) is critical, in order to create significantly higher extrapolation capacity. Panel b: Sparks automates the end-to-end scientific process through four interconnected modules: 1) hypothesis generation, 2) testing, 3) refinement, and 4) documentation. The system begins with a user-defined query, which includes research goals, tools to test the hypothesis, and experimental constraints to guide the experimentation. It then formulates an innovative research idea with a testable hypothesis, followed by rigorous experimentation and refinement cycles. All findings are synthesized into a final document that captures the research objective, methodology, results, and directions for future work, in addition to a shared principle (such as in the examples presented here a scaling law or mechanistic rule). Each module is operated by specialized AI agents with clearly defined, synergistic roles.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to transform the field of protein design. AI-driven breakthroughs have fundamentally altered what is possible in protein science [17, 18]. The advent of AlphaFold, for example, demonstrated that deep learning models can predict protein structures with unprecedented accuracy, solving a problem that had eluded researchers for decades [19]. In parallel, generative models such as Chroma have enabled de novo protein engineering, facilitating the creation of novel folds and functions beyond those found in nature [20]. Deep learning-based surrogate models, capable of predicting protein properties from sequence or structure or vice-versa, have further empowered researchers to optimize protein function at scale [21, 22, 23]. However, these models are limited when it comes to integrating knowledge beyond their training domain—a capability that is essential for genuine scientific discovery, which relies on an iterative deep reasoning process.

In recent years, large-scale foundation models, typified by OpenAI's GPT-40, 01 and 03 or Google Gemini, have become a powerful paradigm to aid in scientific research and other complex tasks [24, 25, 26, 27]. Pre-trained on vast multimodal corpora of text, images, audio and domain-specific data, these reasoning engines can perform cross-domain inference, articulate context-aware hypotheses and generate human-readable scientific narratives [28, 29, 30, 31]. When embedded in a multi-agent framework, individual models take on specialized roles and coordinate via structured messages, enabling collaborative intelligence with in-situ learning [32]. Coupled to domain tools, simulation engines and knowledge graphs, such systems evolve into autonomous research platforms that generate novel ideas, automate complex materials-design tasks and accelerate discovery—exemplified by SciAgents and related efforts [33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Other incipient multi-agent systems have been applied to automate research workflow and assisting scientists across various stages of the scientific process across diverse fields [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. For example, "The AI Scientist" was proposed [40] as a fully autonomous system capable of executing the entire scientific pipeline for AI research. More recently, Google introduced the AI Co-Scientist, a multi-agent system designed for "scientist-in-the-loop" collaboration, positioning AI as an intelligent assistant that can augment human researchers [44]. However, earlier systems primarily targeted discovery within the field of artificial intelligence itself. In physics and related scientific domains, most prior work has focused on hypothesis generation without physics-informed validation, or has left experiment design and validation outside the autonomous core, relying instead on human intervention or external tools.

Despite these advances, the challenge of autonomous discovery in the physical sciences, such as materials science or protein science, remains formidable. Achieving independent, original discovery demands far more than the ability to generate plausible hypotheses; it requires intelligent systems that can integrate diverse forms of knowledge, combine data-driven and physics-based modeling for accurate predictions, and iteratively coordinate multiple dependent steps toward a solution, specifically targeting a novel discovery with generalizable principles as an outcome. Crucially, such systems must design and execute experiments, interpret results, and refine their strategies as new findings emerge. The end goal is not only to automate routine research tasks, but to meet the scientific standards of novelty, reproducibility, and physical meaningfulness—criteria that require both methodological rigor and creative intuition. As we discuss in this study, realizing this vision calls for a new generation of multi-agent systems powered by advanced reasoning AI agents, capable of seamlessly integrating tools, logic, and reasoning in a deeply nonlinear, feedback-driven workflow that can advance the frontier of autonomous scientific discovery.

In this study, we present Sparks, a multi-modal, multi-agent AI model that demonstrates scientific discovery by autonomously orchestrating the entire research process. By combining the reasoning and planning abilities of advanced foundation models with powerful domain-specific computational tools. Sparks enables specialized agents to collaborate seamlessly through key stages of research. This system generates original hypotheses grounded in scientific reasoning, designs and implements computational experiments, interprets results, and adapts its research strategy in real time, without human intervention. Leveraging this integrated approach, Sparks independently proposed a novel hypothesis and then validated it through an iterative experimental approach, leading to a previously unreported, length-dependent mechanical crossover in short protein peptides, establishing a new design principle with broad implications.

Our study marks a significant advance in autonomous scientific discovery by showing that an AI system can transcend its prior knowledge and independently uncover two previously unknown phenomena in protein science. First, Sparks discovered a length-dependent mechanical crossover: beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass their alpha-helical counterparts in maximal unfolding force once the chain length exceeds 80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics. Second, the framework mapped a chain-length by secondary-structure stability landscape, revealing an unexpected intrinsic robustness of beta-sheet-rich proteins and a pronounced "frustration zone" of high conformational variance for mixed alpha/beta folds at moderate lengths. These breakthroughs were achieved with Sparks, our multi-modal, multi-agent AI framework purpose-built for hypothesis-driven research, which autonomously generated hypotheses, designed and executed simulations, iteratively refined its approach, and synthesized the findings without human intervention. Our results establish that AI can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and deliver previously unknown discoveries.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces Sparks, detailing its agentic architecture, agent roles, and the iterative workflow that underpins automated scientific discovery. Section 3 discusses the broader implications of this work, current limitations, and future directions for AI-driven scientific discovery. We provide a detailed analysis of the scientific work done by the AI model and provide the full traceable output for two examples as Supplementary Materials.

### $\overline{2}$ **Results**

We first introduce Sparks and its foundational design concepts, as a tool for driving the scientific discovery process. We then present two case studies to demonstrate how this intelligent system autonomously conducts research by integrating the synergistic capabilities of specialized AI agents and computational tools.

### Multi-agent model for automated hypothesis-driven scientific discovery $2.1$

Figure 1 illustrates the outline of our proposed multi-agent system designed to automate the scientific discovery process. The inputs to the model are a scientific query submitted by the user, a list of available tools, and imposed experimental constraints. The model consists of four main modules which are executed sequentially following a predefined sequence of tasks that ensures consistency and reliability through the scientific discovery process; 1) Idea generation, 2) idea testing, 3) refinement, and  $\overline{4}$ ) documentation. This high-level flow captures the progression from abstract questions to concrete hypotheses, from idea implementation and testing to evaluation and refinement, and ultimately to the synthesis of findings and documentation. Sparks is a multi-agent model where the scientific discovery pipeline is by agents carefully designed via prompting to play a specific role.

An overview of the entire automated AI-driven process is illustrated in Figure 2(a), from idea generation to the final document. The process begins with the Idea Generation module which, in response to the User's query and inputs, generates a novel research hypothesis that is both novel and feasible within the system's computational constraints. Following hypothesis generation, the system enters the Idea Testing module, where the hypothesis is tested. This phase includes writing a Python script that carefully implements the idea by calling and executing the tools, processing and storing outputs in structured JSON format, and documenting the workflow for explainability and reproducibility. Next, the results are provided to the Refinement module for evaluation and assess whether the data collected sufficiently address the research question. If not, the system autonomously designs and performs additional follow-up experiments. This loop continues until convergence or until the user-defined testing limit or experiment constraints are reached. This mechanism ensures that the system neither under-explores nor expends unnecessary computational resources, adapting its workflow based on observed outcomes. Finally, Sparks transitions to the documentation phase where the system integrates all the previous content and results and writes a comprehensive report. In this phase, the system synthesizes the entire research trajectory, generating visualizations, summarizing findings, and compiling them into a structured scientific document. The report is designed to be interpretable, verifiable, and reusable, supporting external human analysis.

Each module in Sparks is empowered by a set of AI agents with specialized prompting to yield a reliable, complete, and accurate response. Each agent has a profile describing its role in the system. An overview of the Agents recruited in Sparks is shown in Figure  $2(b)$  aligned with a description of their role in the system. Certain agents also have the ability to solicit new physical data and insights, such as by setting up and running molecular dynamics simulations.

In the following sections, we provide an in-depth exploration of each module in Sparks and the intermodular agents. Together, they form a system that does more than predict or generate outputs, it engages in a sustained, reflective scientific workflow. By combining hypothesis-driven exploration, computational implementation, and structured iteration, Sparks represents a step toward systems that do not merely assist science but actively practice it.

### Idea Generation: formulating novel and feasible idea $2.2$

The idea generation module serves as a foundational component of the system, initiating the scientific discovery process through the creation of structured, testable research ideas. This module is composed of two specialized agents, scientist\_1 and scientist\_2, each guided by carefully designed prompts that define their respective roles and responsibilities.

The process begins with a query, which serves as the entry point for the discovery workflow. The query represents a high-level scientific task or research goal posed by the user. It defines the overall direction of the investigation and serves as the conceptual anchor from which all hypotheses are derived. The query may be broad or targeted but must be interpretable within the system's constraints and executable using the available tools.

Image /page/4/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of a research workflow, with four main stages: Idea Generation, Idea Testing, Refinement, and Documentation. Each stage is represented by a box with a robot icon at the top. Arrows connect the stages, indicating the flow of the workflow. The Idea Generation stage includes elements such as "Query", "Tools", "Constraints", "Idea", "hypothesis", "mechanism", "outcome", "approach", "feasibility", "novelty", and "challenge". The Idea Testing stage includes "Research idea", "Tools", "Constraints", "Python code", "execution", "results.json", "final\_results.json", and "notes.txt". The Refinement stage includes "Research idea", "code", "results.json", "notes.txt", "Python code", "execution", "results.json", "final\_results.json", and "notes.txt". The Documentation stage includes "Research idea", "Plots", "code", "results.json", "notes.txt", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Conclusion", and "Outlook". Below the diagram, there are descriptions of the roles of different agents in the workflow, including Scientist\_1, Coder\_1, Refiner\_1, Writer\_1, Scientist\_2, Coder\_2, Refiner\_2, and Writer\_2. Each agent has a brief description of their responsibilities and tasks within the research process.

Figure 2: (a) Overview of the entire process from idea generation to the final document. First, the Idea Generation module formulates a high-impact research idea. Then in the testing module translates these hypotheses into executable workflows, autonomously conducting simulations or analyses to generate quantitative results. The refinement module is responsible for refining the testing strategy based on the results, adaptively revising the experimental design through an iterative feedback loop that sharpens insight and prompts reliable hypothesis testing; and writer agents consolidate the entire research lifecycle into a comprehensive document that not only presents key findings and methodologies, but also outlines future research directions—effectively serving as a blueprint for subsequent scientific inquiry. (b) Overview of the AI Agents and their role implemented in Sparks. Each module operates through a structured yet adaptive sequence of agent interactions, enabling consistency and context-aware responses across the research workflow. Each agent dynamically adapts to previous content in real time, ensuring. Inter-modular agents facilitate a generation-reflection strategy, using dynamic prompts to process evolving inputs and coordinate outputs, ensuring the system adapts fluidly to new insights throughout the research process.

- Scientist\_1: Given the query, tools, and constraints, through careful prompting as shown in Figure 3, the scientist 1 is tasked with formulating a novel, scientifically sound, and computationally feasible research idea. The agent receives a structured prompt containing the query, a list of accessible tools, and a set of experimentation constraints. The output of this agent is a structured research proposal composed of the key components: idea, hypothesis, mechanism, outcome, approach, feasibility, novelty, and challenge.
- Scientist 2 After scientist 1 submits the initial proposal, the scientist 2 agent reviews the idea and reflects on its clarity, novelty, feasibility, and alignment with system constraints. This agent operates using a structured prompt that mirrors the format of the original idea, allowing it to directly assess and revise each component if necessary. The reflection process may include improving the scientific precision of definitions, refining the hypothesis structure, or modifying the approach to better fit the system's operational limits. If the proposed idea meets all criteria, the reflection agent returns it unmodified. Otherwise, it produces a revised version, ensuring that only well-formed and executable hypotheses proceed to the testing phase.

Together, the generation (scientist 1) and reflection (scientist 2) agents form a tightly coupled mechanism for idea formulation. Their interaction ensures that research ideas generated by the system are not only creative and exploratory but also practical, testable, and fully aligned with the computational capabilities of Sparks. This module thus serves as a critical foundation for iterative, automated scientific exploration.

Figure 3: Overview of the Scientist<sub>1</sub> prompt. The prompt takes the user's query, a list of available tools, and experiment constraints as input. The agent is tasked with generating novel research ideas, guided by instructions to promote both novelty and feasibility. The agent is required to return a research idea containing several key component.

### 2.3 Idea Testing: Translating hypothesis into executable workflows

This module serves as another core component of the scientific reasoning and validation process, transforming abstract research ideas into concrete, testable investigations. It is responsible for implementing the proposed approach and generating evidence to evaluate the underlying hypothesis. Guided by the defined objectives, available tools, and experimental constraints, the system constructs an executable workflow—typically in Python—to simulate and analyze the hypothesis in a systematic manner. The goal is to enable rigorous, transparent, and repeatable testing within the boundaries of the system's capabilities.

This module focuses on a first-pass implementation of the idea, aiming to validate its feasibility under current conditions, and is managed by two agents that work in tandem to construct the computational workflow

• Coder 1: The coder agent is responsible for generating a Python script that faithfully implements the research idea. The agent receives a structured prompt that includes the original query, the hypothesis to be tested, a list of available computational tools, and a set of implementation constraints. The script must be self-contained and executable, and all results must be stored using a standardized format to support reproducibility and downstream analysis. Specifically, raw and intermediate outputs are saved in results json, final outcomes in final results json, and workflow metadata—including parameter choices, file names, function usage, and relevant justifications—are recorded in notes.txt. • Coder 2: Once the script is generated, the coder reflection agent evaluates it for technical correctness, completeness, and adherence to system standards. This agent checks whether the appropriate tools have been used, whether the outputs are generated and saved properly, and whether the computational procedure aligns with the original hypothesis. If any issues are detected—such as omissions, incorrect function calls, or data-saving inconsistencies—the reflection agent modifies the code accordingly. If the script is deemed valid, it is passed forward without modification.

The division of responsibilities between these two agents improves reliability by ensuring that every hypothesis is translated into a consistent, reproducible, and verifiable computational procedure. All outputs are stored in a structured format, enabling traceability throughout the research process and supporting the next stages of discovery, where previous results may be revisited or extended as outlined below.

### $2.4$ Refinement: informative follow-up testing

The refinement module plays a critical role in Sparks's autonomous scientific workflow by serving as an iterative checkpoint after initial testing. Its primary goal is to reassess the hypothesis in light of early results and determine whether further experimentation is needed. Since initial tests may not fully capture the complexity of the scientific problem, this module ensures that conclusions are not drawn from incomplete data, failed assumptions, or inconclusive evidence. It is particularly valuable in cases where results exhibit high variability or where subtle trends warrant deeper investigation.

To perform this task, Sparks deploys two specialized agents in the refinement module:

- Refiner 1: This agent is responsible for the first layer of evaluation. It is given full access to the contextual information from the previous round, including the hypothesis, implementation code, summary results (final\_results.json), detailed logs and raw outputs (results.json), and experiment notes (notes.txt). Refiner\_1 analyzes these files to assess the robustness and coverage of the initial testing. If gaps are identified—such as insufficient sampling, invalid assumptions, or ambiguous results—it generates a revised version of the experiment script. The updated code is designed to build on the previous run, reusing existing data and appending new results in a consistent manner. Care is taken to preserve variable naming conventions and file structures to ensure continuity and prevent data overwriting.
- Refiner 2: This agent reviews the decision and implementation proposed by Refiner 1. If additional testing is deemed necessary, Refiner\_2 validates the revised code for correctness, completeness, and internal consistency. It may also fix errors or enhance the code for better performance and reliability. If no follow-up is required, the agent terminates the testing loop and returns a definitive "NO\_FOLLOWUP" flag, signaling the system to proceed to the documentation phase.

This refinement loop can continue for multiple rounds (requiring increasing amounts of compute), enabling Sparks to iteratively improve its understanding of the problem. The process concludes when either no further testing is required or the system reaches a predefined limit on testing rounds, denoted by  $N_{\text{test}}$ . At that point, the workflow transitions to the documentation phase, where the results and insights are formally compiled.

## 2.5 Documentation to Yield a Traceble, Coherent and Structured Narrative

Once hypothesis generation and validation are complete, Sparks transitions to the documentation phase, where a detailed and structured research manuscript is generated. This document not only compiles results from previous stages but also refines the original proposal, offering enriched analysis and deeper insights. The manuscript includes plots, tables, and structured interpretations to enhance clarity, transparency, and scientific communication. Key elements such as insights, impacts, limitations, and future research directions are also addressed.

To ensure comprehensive and high-quality output, we implement a multi-stage documentation pipeline driven by specialized agents. Each agent is responsible for generating one specific section of the manuscript, Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion, and Outlook, using carefully designed prompting strategies. The modularity of this pipeline guarantees that each section is internally coherent and collectively forms a scientifically rigorous narrative.

Before the main documentation process begins, a dedicated plotting submodule is activated to visualize the results and enable multimodal interpretation. This submodule is driven by the following agents:

- Plot Designer 1: This agent receives the research idea and results from preceding modules, selects the most suitable plot types to represent the data, and generates a Python script to create high-quality visualizations. It ensures that the plots reveal patterns, trends, or anomalies critical to hypothesis evaluation. The agent is instructed to, where applicable, perform regression analysis, overlay fitting curves, and return the associated fitting parameters in json format.
- This agent reviews the code generated by Plot\_Designer\_1. It checks for • Plot Designer 2: accuracy, completeness, and clarity, and suggests improvements or additional visualizations to better support data interpretation. It may also revise the code to correct errors or enhance scientific utility.
- Plot\_Analyzer: Once the plots are generated, this agent analyzes each figure in the context of the original hypothesis and research question. It provides a structured interpretation, describing observed patterns, correlations, and their implications. Additionally, it produces a caption for each figure and summarizes key insights in a concise format.

Following plot generation and analysis, the system proceeds to compile the manuscript written in IATFX. This stage is orchestrated by a suite of foundation model based writing agents:

Writing Agents Each section of the manuscript is composed by a dedicated agent:

- Introduction: Presents the research objective, motivation, hypothesis, and challenges. It situates the problem within the broader scientific context.
- Methods: Describes the design rationale, parameter space, computational workflow, and tools used. It also highlights the challenges encountered during implementation.
- Results: Discusses key findings, interprets the outcomes, evaluates the hypothesis, and identifies scientific contributions and limitations.
- Conclusion: Summarizes the most important results, synthesizes insights, and articulates the study's broader significance.
- Outlook: Identifies unresolved questions and proposes future research directions. It also suggests new hypotheses inspired by the current findings.

**Reflection Agent** Each of the five writer agents is paired with a Reflection Agent responsible for reviewing the corresponding section. It checks for completeness, accuracy, depth, and clarity. The Reflection Agent may expand the text, clarify ambiguities, and enhance scientific detail. For each section, it also generates a highlighted summary box that distills the key takeaways—main findings, conclusions, and their implications.

Together, these agents collaboratively generate a final document that encapsulates the entire research process—from hypothesis and experimentation to interpretation and projection. This document serves as a springboard for human researchers to build upon the AI's work, refine methods, or explore new directions, facilitating a collaborative and iterative model of scientific discovery.

## 2.6 Science Discovery Example I: Length-dependent Helix-Sheet Mechanical Crossover in **Short Peptides**

Sparks is designed as a domain-adaptable system for automated scientific discovery across a wide range of disciplines. Its flexibility stems from a modular architecture, where domain-specific tools, constraints, and instructions are supplied as inputs to adapt the system's behavior to the research context. These inputs define the overall research objective, computational capabilities, and experimental limitations, guiding the scientific inquiry in a targeted, structured, and interpretable manner. Importantly, the agent prompts—including their objectives, operational instructions, and expected output formats—are defined in a domain-agnostic way, enabling Sparks to generalize scientific discovery workflows across disciplines.

In this study, we demonstrate Sparks's capabilities in the context of protein design. Progress in this field is hindered by the vastness of amino acid sequence space, the intricacies of atomic-scale folding, and the complex mapping between structure and function. These challenges have historically made protein science highly dependent on expert intuition and trial-and-error approaches.

Sparks fills this gap by unifying hypothesis generation, computational planning, tool-based execution, and iterative reflection into a single AI-driven multi-agent framework. In this work, we showcase Sparks's ability to autonomously formulate and test hypotheses, ultimately uncovering novel physical insights in short protein peptides. Notably, the system independently discovered a previously unreported size-dependent phenomenon—revealing a mechanical crossover effect in peptides of varying lengths.

The inputs to the system for this example are outlined in Figure  $4(a)$ . To test the model's capacity for creative exploration, we provide a general research query without directing the system toward any specific hypothesis space. Sparks is then equipped with a set of domain-relevant tools as shown in Figure  $4(a)$ : generative models for creating structure-biased protein sequences of a given length, a folding tool to predict 3D structures and produce PDB files, and pre-trained autoregressive models to estimate mechanical unfolding forces and energies from sequences. For simplicity and efficiency, we define a small set of computational constraints. We also set the total number of follow-up rounds to 3. The complete research document autonomously generated by Sparks for this example is presented in Section S1 in SI. In the following sections, we examine the results and the scientific insights derived from this fully automated investigation.

| Hypothesis          | A critical length $L \approx 55$ amino acids exists within the 30-80 residue range,<br>beyond which β-sheet-biased peptides exhibit higher maximum unfolding force<br>(Fmax) than α-helix-biased peptides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Mechanism           | α-helices reach mechanical saturation at shorter lengths due to intra-chain<br>hydrogen bonding. In contrast, β-sheets require longer chains for inter-strand<br>hydrogen bonding to dominate, leading to a length-dependent mechanical<br>crossover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Novelty             | In contrast to previous studies that focused on long protein domains or isolated<br>structural motifs, this work systematically varies both peptide length and<br>structural bias in the short peptide regime, targeting a previously unexplored<br>mechanical transition point.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Approach            | A high-throughput in silico pipeline is used to generate balanced libraries of α-<br>helix- and β-sheet-biased peptides at six discrete lengths (30-80 residues, in<br>steps of 10).

| Expected<br>Outcome | Force-length profiles will show that α-helix-biased peptides dominate at shorter<br>lengths (30-50 residues), while β-sheet-biased peptides become stronger at<br>longer lengths (60-80 residues).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

(b) Structured research idea generated by the AI model in the Idea Generation module. (c) Multi-stage AI-driven evaluation of the hypothesis, incorporating testing and refinement. (d) Final document created by the model, provides a comprehensive overview of the research, including key results that demonstrate the length-dependent mechanical crossover—where  $\beta$ -sheet-biased peptides surpass  $\alpha$ -helix-biased peptides in unfolding force as the peptide length increases. The full document is provided in Section S1 of the SI.

**Ideation** In response to the query, the scientist agents propose a research idea aimed at investigating a length-dependent mechanical phenomenon in short peptides. The central hypothesis posits the existence of a critical peptide length at which  $\beta$ -sheet-biased sequences exhibit greater mechanical strength than their  $\alpha$ -helical counterparts. The core components of this AI-generated research idea are summarized in Figure  $4(b)$ .

As demonstrated, the AI-generated idea and hypothesis highlight the proficiency of Sparks in formulating welldefined, testable scientific hypotheses grounded in the principles of biomolecular mechanics. The hypothesis introduces a specific crossover length at which  $\beta$ -sheet-biased peptides are predicted to surpass  $\alpha$ -helical ones

in mechanical strength—a nontrivial, length-dependent phenomenon. It also contextualizes the novelty of the idea through comparison with prior studies, highlighting a gap in existing literature. The model not only articulates the hypothesis clearly but also outlines a rigorous, computationally tractable approach for testing it. By proposing a systematic in silico pipeline that generates balanced peptide libraries, ensures structural fidelity through folding validation, and applies statistical analysis to quantify crossover trends and uncertainties, the model defines a complete experimental plan. This reflects its capacity to autonomously generate scientifically meaningful, mechanistically interpretable, and experimentally actionable hypotheses—thereby accelerating the path from idea to investigation and discovery in protein science.

**Testing** Next, the system proceeds with testing the hypothesized length-dependent mechanical crossover between  $\alpha$ -helix- and  $\beta$ -sheet-biased short peptides by implementing a structured and detailed evaluation strategy. As outlined in Section 2.3, the testing module operates in two phases: an initial implementation phase focused on pipeline validation and rapid hypothesis evaluation, followed by targeted follow-up rounds designed to address limitations identified in the earlier stage.

Key elements of the experimental workflow executed in this example are summarized in  $4(c)$ . The results of this iterative testing framework demonstrate the effectiveness and scientific rigor of the Sparks system in performing autonomous hypothesis evaluation:

- The multi-round workflow enables incremental improvements in data quality, statistical power, and structural validation through systematic refinement.
- Each round builds upon the previous, supporting staged error detection, quality control, and data enrichment in a modular, extensible fashion.
- All data and metadata—including per-sample results, designed sequences, PDB structures, and Python scripts—are automatically archived, ensuring full traceability, transparency, and reproducibility.
- The entire pipeline—from hypothesis formulation to dataset generation, structure prediction, and statistical analysis—is executed end-to-end without human intervention.

Hypothesis evaluation and testing is a critical step in the scientific discovery process, demanding structured workflows, iterative execution, and robust data analysis. Sparks addresses these needs through its multi-step testing module, offering a transparent, reproducible, and fully autonomous computational framework for scientific hypothesis testing.

**Results** We present the results produced by the AI model, as analyzed and structured by the plotting and documentation modules. The full analyses are available in Section S1 of the Supplementary Information. Below, we summarize the main scientific contributions generated by Sparks, highlighting its effectiveness in uncovering novel scientific principles.

- A summary of the core statistical data obtained by Sparks is presented in the Table shown in Figure  $5(a)$ . The first key observation is that  $\alpha$ -helix-biased libraries exhibited consistently high retention rates (9–10 out of 10 per length), whereas  $\beta$ -sheet-biased libraries showed higher attrition (4–9 out of 10 per length), reflecting the inherent structural difficulty of stabilizing extended  $\beta$  motifs in short peptides.
- To quantify trends in mechanical performance, the model performed regression analysis on the dependence of  $F_{\text{max}}$  and  $\Delta F_{\text{max}}$  with respect to peptide length and structural bias. This analysis revealed novel scaling relationships. Notably,  $F_{\text{max}}$  in  $\beta$ -sheet peptides increased with length at a rate five times higher than in  $\alpha$ -helices. The high  $R^2$  value for  $\beta$ -sheets (0.89) suggests a nearlinear length-dependent strengthening, whereas  $\alpha$ -helices exhibited more erratic behavior and early saturation.
- The model synthesized the results into clear visual representations (Figure 5(a), showing the relationship between peptide length and median maximal unfolding force for both  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet motifs. Dashed regression lines, annotated with fitting equations and  $R^2$  values, quantified these trends. The model also provided a detailed, data-driven interpretation of the plot.
- A particularly striking result is the observed crossover point in mechanical strength. At a peptide length of 80 amino acids,  $\beta$ -sheets achieved a median  $F_{\text{max}}$  of 0.399 (CI: [0.303, 0.417]), overtaking  $\alpha$ -helices, which reached 0.313 (CI: [0.313, 0.379]). This marks a clear reversal in the hierarchy of force resistance.

• To analyze the distributional features of unfolding forces, the model generates box-and-whisker plots for all quality-controlled samples at each sequence length and structural bias, as shown in Figure 5(b). As shown in the image, the AI model autonomously interprets this plot to derive several key conclusions. First, for  $\alpha$ -helix peptides, the plots reveal consistently narrow force distributions across all lengths, indicating a robust, length-insensitive mechanical response. In contrast, the variance of unfolding forces in  $\beta$ -sheet peptides increases with length, reflecting greater heterogeneity at longer chain lengths. This broader distribution in  $\beta$ -biased proteins at higher lengths may result from access to multiple folding or stacking modes, leading to diverse mechanical phenotypes. This suggests that  $\beta$ -sheets could form protofibrils or multi-layer structures, which may enhance mechanical strength but also increase variability.

Mechanical unfolding forces of short peptides as a function of<br>length. Median maximal unfolding force (Fmax, arbitrary units, a.u.) is plotted against peptide length (30-80 amino acids, aa) for a-helical (a, red) and  $\beta$ -sheet ( $\beta$ , blue) constructs; error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals derived from bootstrapped datasets. Linear regressions (dashed) yield a near-flat slope for  $\alpha$ -helices (0.001 a.u./aa, R2 = 0.42) and a four-fold steeper slope for β-sheets (0.004 a.u./aa,  $R2 = 0.89$ ).  $β$ -sheets transition from mechanically weaker to stronger than  $a$ -helices at  $\sim$  65 aa, indicating a length-dependent helixsheet crossover. The flat a-helix curve suggests early saturation of axial hydrogen-bond strength, whereas the linear  $\beta$ -sheet trend implies cooperative shear loading of inter-strand bonds. Increasing dispersion of βsheet forces with length hints at heterogeneous failure pathways. These findings refine the<br>critical crossover length, highlight distinct scaling regimes for the two secondary structures, and motivate future studies into cooperative versus sequential unfolding mechanisms.

The y-axis is labeled 'Median Fmax (a.u.)' and ranges from 0.15 to 0.40. There are two data sets plotted on the figure: alpha-helix and beta-sheet. The alpha-helix data is plotted in red, and the beta-sheet data is plotted in blue. The alpha-helix data has a linear fit of y=0.001x+0.27 with an R-squared value of 0.42.

Figure 5: Dataset overview and visualization of AI-discovered mechanical trends in short peptides. The table and plots presented here were autonomously generated by Sparks and highlight a length-dependent crossover in mechanical strength between peptide classes. In addition to producing these plots, the multi-modal model interprets the data, revealing key features such as the heterogeneity and distribution of unfolding forces. This integrated approach enhances the scientific value of the results by combining automated data analysis with interpretable visual outputs.

**Conclusion** The model offers a compelling mechanistic explanation for the observed crossover. It posits that  $\alpha$ -helices reach mechanical saturation at shorter lengths due to limited intra-helical hydrogen bonds and a linear force-bearing architecture. In contrast,  $\beta$ -sheets benefit from the addition of strands, which increases the number of parallel hydrogen bonds and enables cooperative load-sharing. This advantage becomes increasingly significant at longer lengths, resulting in super-linear strengthening and eventual mechanical dominance.

In summary, the model establishes—through comprehensive, high-resolution computational analysis—a previously unrecognized, length-dependent inversion in mechanical strength between  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet motifs in short peptides. It successfully integrates hypothesis formulation, simulation, analysis, and mechanistic interpretation into a coherent scientific narrative.

**Outlook** At the final stage of the research cycle, the model autonomously identifies open challenges in the current work and proposes new hypotheses and research directions to address them. Below are several forward-looking contributions generated by the model:

- The model emphasizes the need for atomic-level understanding of the structural and molecular interactions responsible for the observed crossover. It outlines computational and experimental strategies to probe these mechanisms more deeply.
- It highlights a key unresolved question: what is the precise **molecular mechanism** by which  $\beta$ -sheet motifs surpass  $\alpha$ -helices in mechanical resistance with increasing length?
- The current framework cannot resolve detailed atomic-scale features such as side-chain packing, hydrogen bond orientation, water-mediated stabilization, or non-native contact formation. Moreover, sequence-specific factors—like hydrophobicity, charge distribution, and the presence of proline or glycine—remain underexplored in relation to mechanical heterogeneity and failure modes.
- To address these gaps, the model proposes a set of follow-up investigations, including all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations to examine the unfolding of  $\alpha$ -helical,  $\beta$ -sheet, and hybrid peptides. These simulations would track hydrogen bond rupture, secondary structure transitions, and the roles of solvent-exposed versus buried residues. It also suggests analyzing force-extension curves to detect cooperative strand recruitment, slippage, or unzipping. In addition, the model recommends experimental approaches such as single-molecule force spectroscopy and multi-scale modeling to identify dominant unfolding pathways and intermediate structures.

These findings demonstrate that Sparks is not only capable of executing hypothesis-driven scientific investigations but also of identifying meaningful gaps and proposing actionable next steps. Its ability to autonomously design future studies—rooted in rigorous analysis and mechanistic insight—illustrates a transformative shift in how intelligent models can contribute to the scientific process. Sparks represents a new paradigm in AI-assisted discovery, one in which autonomous agents play a generative and strategic role in shaping future research directions.

### $2.7$ Science Discovery Example II: AI-Driven Insights into Protein Stability

To further demonstrate the versatility of our AI-driven model for automated scientific discovery, we present an additional case study that underscores the model's ability to tackle complex scientific tasks through high-throughput simulations. A summary of the study and key findings is provided below; comprehensive results, methodology, and suggestion for future research are detailed in the final document generated by Sparks (see Section S2 in the Supplementary Information).

The central aim of this study was to systematically examine how protein chain length influences the interplay between secondary structure content—specifically,  $\alpha$ -helix,  $\beta$ -sheet, and mixed motifs—and thermodynamic stability, as measured by the maximum backbone root-mean-square deviation  $(RMSD_{max})$  during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that allows the model to elicit new "first principles" data to expand the discovery.

Using a fully automated, high-throughput *de novo* design and analysis pipeline, the model generated a balanced, bias-validated dataset spanning a wide range of chain lengths and secondary structure classes. This enabled detailed, quantitative mapping of the two-dimensional landscape defined by chain length and secondary structure composition, clarifying how these fundamental parameters govern protein stability.

## Key findings:

• Unexpected robustness of  $\beta$ -sheet architectures: Across all chain lengths,  $\beta$ -rich proteins consistently exhibited the lowest median  $\text{RMSD}_{\text{max}}$ , challenging the classical view that stable  $\beta$ -sheets require longer chains for effective pairing and hydrogen bonding (see Figure  $6(a)$ ).

- Non-monotonic stability profile of  $\alpha$ -helical proteins:  $\alpha$ -rich proteins showed a shallow. non-monotonic trend, peaking in median  $\text{RMSD}_{\text{max}}$  at  $L = 60$ , then improving at longer lengths. This suggests a trade-off between local helix stabilization and optimal packing.  $(6(a))$
- Pronounced length sensitivity in mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  folds: Mixed-content proteins were least stable at short lengths  $(L = 40-60)$  but stabilized significantly as length increased, highlighting the importance of sufficient chain length for cooperative folding in hybrid structures. (Figure  $6(a)$ )
- High variance and the "frustration zone": Mixed proteins showed greater variance in stability, with two-dimensional mapping revealing a "frustration zone" for balanced  $\alpha/\beta$  content ( $|\Delta SS| < 25\%$ ), characterized by broad  $RMSD_{max}$  dispersion, likely due to competing folding nuclei. (see Figure  $6(b)$
- Class-specific sensitivity to disorder: Analysis of coil content (unstructured regions) showed  $\beta$ -rich proteins become sharply unstable when coil content exceeds  $\sim 30\%$ , while  $\alpha$ -rich proteins tolerate higher disorder with only modest increases in  $\text{RMSD}_{\text{max}}$ . (see Figure 6(c))

Our AI model revealed several important scientific impacts. By systematically decoupling chain length from secondary structure bias, the model challenged conventional assumptions about  $\beta$ -sheet stability and underscored the critical role of chain length, especially in mixed architectures. Additionally, the identification of a "frustration zone" by the mdoel (where protein stability is highly sensitive to secondary structure composition—along with the mapping of stability as a function of structural bias) provides actionable guidance for protein design. The results suggest that favoring strong  $\alpha$  or  $\beta$  bias, ensuring sufficient length for cooperative folding, and minimizing exposed interfaces are effective strategies for enhancing stability in mixed architectures. The analysis also indicates that minimizing coil or disordered content is particularly important for  $\beta$ -rich proteins, while  $\alpha$ -rich designs are more robust to moderate disorder.

Nonetheless, our AI-driven approach also highlighted several limitations. The use of  $RMSD_{max}$  as a stability metric, while common, is an imperfect proxy that may miss slow unfolding events or alternative folding pathways. The molecular dynamics simulations sample only limited timescales, which could lead to underestimation of the instability of marginally stable designs. Furthermore, the design and folding tools employed by the model may introduce bias by favoring certain topologies or sequence features. Finally, high variance, particularly among mixed proteins, reduces statistical power and may limit the detection of significant class differences.

We find that this high-throughput analysis reveals a complex, class- and length-dependent landscape of protein stability:  $\beta$ -rich architectures exhibit unexpected robustness, mixed architectures show pronounced length sensitivity, and  $\alpha$ -rich proteins follow modest non-monotonic trends. These findings refine classical models, offer practical design guidelines, and open new avenues for mechanistic and experimental exploration into protein foldability and stability.

### Discussion 3

The central finding of this work is that an adversarial, task-specialized generation-reflection architecture enables foundation models to transcend their training distribution and synthesize genuinely novel scientific knowledge. The foundational strategy is based on an AI-native, hypothesis-driven, multi-modal, and multiagent model designed to autonomously execute the full cycle of scientific discovery. Sparks operationalizes this vision by incorporating a set of specialized AI agents—each tasked with distinct roles such as hypothesis generation, experimental design, testing, interpretation, and scientific writing. These agents interact with domain-aware computational tools to carry out research under clearly defined methodological and resource constraints.

Our demonstration pushes the frontier of scientific use cases of AI from retrospective pattern recognition to prospective knowledge creation: a self-organizing, multi-agent AI model that (i) formulates falsifiable hypotheses entirely outside its training distribution, (ii) orchestrates domain tools to execute and iteratively refine physics-based experiments, and (iii) distills the outcomes into mechanistic principles that withstand independent scrutiny. In proving that a foundation-model architecture can close this full hypothesize-testdiscover loop without human heuristics, we establish a concrete benchmark for out-of-distribution scientific creativity—transforming large-scale AI from an accelerant of human research into an autonomous engine of new science.

Using case studies in protein mechanics, we demonstrated that Sparks can autonomously propose mechanistically grounded hypotheses, translate them into executable protocols, test and refine them iteratively,

Image /page/13/Figure/1 description: The image contains three scatter plots related to protein stability and structure. The first plot (a) shows the median maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) in Angstroms (Å) versus protein length in amino acids (aa). There are three data series: alpha, beta, and mixed, each with data points and error bars. Trend lines are fitted to each series, with R-squared values of 0.32 for alpha, 0.12 for beta, and 0.61 for mixed. The x-axis ranges from 40 to 120 aa, and the y-axis ranges from 2.0 to 5.5 Å. The second plot (b) shows the maximum RMSD (Å) versus the difference between the percentage of alpha-helix and beta-sheet content (ΔSS = %H - %E). The data points are colored according to protein length, ranging from 40 to 120 aa. The x-axis ranges from -100 to 75, and the y-axis ranges from 2 to 16 Å. The third plot (c) shows the maximum RMSD (Å) versus coil/unstructured content (%). The data points are colored according to protein type: alpha, beta, and mixed. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 70%, and the y-axis ranges from 2 to 16 Å.

and synthesize the findings into a structured report covering all the key aspects of the research. Remarkably, without human intervention, the model discovered a length-dependent mechanical crossover in short peptides—a previously undocumented phenomenon that highlights a new design principle in protein mechanics. This underscores Sparks's role not just as an analytical assistant, but as a generative scientific agent capable of producing domain-relevant insights.

The key to sophisticated scientific reasoning in Sparks is the integration of diverse capabilities. In this work we leveraged Chroma's generative capabilities to design diverse protein sequences with targeted structural features, and employed a surrogate model to predict the mechanical strength of these sequences based solely on their primary structure, along with native code-writing, visual analysis, and the capability to solicit new physical data from MD simulation. These tools interface with a set of foundation models that then enabled Sparks to rapidly explore high-dimensional sequence and structure spaces, generate and evaluate hypotheses, and iteratively refine its search for novel phenomena. The integration of generative design and predictive modeling forms the backbone of our approach. At the core of Sparks lies a proposer-critic loop: outputs from Scientist<sub>1</sub>, Coder<sub>1</sub>, and Refiner<sub>1</sub> are immediately assessed by their isomorphic critics (Scientist\_2, Coder\_2, Refiner\_2)—agents that share the same model class and prompt schema but are focused on evaluation rather than generation. This self-adversarial pipeline performs automated verification and disagreement-based exploration, guiding the search toward regions of elevated epistemic uncertainty

where the system can sample out-of-distribution configurations and identify novel physical principles by finding unifying principles that explain the new observation.

Although this demonstration focused on protein systems, Sparks's architecture is inherently domain-agnostic. Any scientific domain where hypotheses can be encoded as computational workflows and validated with quantitative metrics—such as materials science, drug discovery, environmental modeling, or energy systems—can adopt the same multi-agent structure. The framework's modularity enables seamless substitution of tools and agent types; for example, literature mining agents, robotic lab controllers, or real-time data stream processors can be integrated via standardized interfaces [45]. Additionally, Sparks incorporates an internal generation-reflection loop that serves as a built-in quality control mechanism—ensuring logical consistency, reproducibility, and self-correction throughout the pipeline. These design choices position Sparks as a foundation for autonomous AI laboratories capable of continuously exploring complex design spaces, uncovering patterns, and producing reproducible scientific outputs with minimal human oversight [46].

While Sparks demonstrates strong performance in autonomously navigating hypothesis-driven research, its effectiveness is currently best realized in domains where hypotheses can be evaluated using well-defined, quantitative outputs, such as force, energy, or statistical trends derived from structured simulation pipelines. These settings allow the system to leverage its full computational reasoning, testing, and interpretation capabilities without relying on external empirical validation.

However, many areas of science require complex, high-dimensional, and often qualitative reasoning, which remain challenging even for human experts. For example, interpreting all-atom molecular dynamics unfolding trajectories, analyzing subtle conformational transitions, or performing wet-lab experiments involving noise, experimental failure, or real-time adaptation go beyond what current large-scale foundation models and automation frameworks can fully capture. These tasks often require deep domain knowledge, interpretive flexibility, and the ability to correlate disparate forms of data, and specifically a type of scientific judgment that is difficult to encode as a deterministic or rule-based process. Sparks actively identifies these limitations in its self-generated documentation. In our case study, the system explicitly flagged key open questions—such as the atomistic mechanisms behind the helix-sheet mechanical crossover—and proposed future work involving steered molecular dynamics, force spectroscopy, and experimental validation. This demonstrates not only task awareness but also a kind of scientific meta-cognition, where the system knows when it has reached the limits of computational reasoning and recommends the involvement of more advanced physical or experimental tools.

Future work could explore a variety of additional directions. For instance, the ideation phase relies on static large-scale foundation model knowledge, which restricts the system's access to emerging findings beyond its training data. This can be mitigated in the future through integration with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dynamic access to scholarly databases, and the incorporation of structured, domain-specific knowledge graphs [47, 33] to enrich real-time context and evidence. Also, the assessment of scientific novelty is currently performed by manual human inspection. Future iterations could include automated novelty detection using tools like Semantic Scholar to compare proposed hypotheses against existing literature. This would strengthen the transparency, trust, and academic rigor of Sparks's outputs—paving the way for AI-generated science that is not only credible but also verifiably original.

### **Materials and Methods** $\overline{\mathbf{4}}$

## 4.1 Agentic Modeling

Sparks's AI agents are implemented using the GPT-4 family of large language models, accessed via OpenAI's Chat Completion API. Each agent's response is generated using a custom function, get\_response\_from\_LLM (adapted from [40]). This function wraps the core API call and structures each agent's communication in a modular and reusable way. It accepts the following arguments:

- system\_message: Defines the agent's role and governs its general behavior.
- prompt: Encodes the agent's goal, task-specific instructions, output formatting, and placeholders for runtime context.
- model: Specifies the OpenAI model assigned to the agent (e.g., gpt-4.1, gpt-4o).
- reasoning effort: Allows the use of high-capacity reasoning models (e.g.,  $\circ$ 1,  $\circ$ 3) depending on task complexity.
- temperature: Controls the randomness or determinism of the generated response.

• msg history: Allows injection of prior message history into the current prompt, enabling context reuse across multiple calls. If set to empty, the agent begins with no prior conversation history.

For the generation agents, we used the following models: Scientist 1 employed 03 (03-2025-04-16) with a temperature of 1; Coder 1 used o3-mini (o3-mini-2025-01-31) with a temperature of 0. All other generation agents were run with  $\circ$ 3 ( $\circ$ 3-2025-04-16) at temperature 0.

For the reflection agents, we utilized  $gpt-4.1$  (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14), with the temperature set to zero.

Full prompt templates and message configurations for all agents are available in the source code.

## 4.2 Agentic Generation-Reflection Mechanism

As outlined in the main text, Sparks employs a generation-reflection strategy, where each core agent is paired with a corresponding reflection agent to evaluate and improve its output. These are typically referred to as Agent 1 (the generator) and Agent 2 (the reflector).

The generation agent produces its initial response with an empty msg\_history, meaning it operates without any prior conversational context. Once the response is generated, the full chat history—comprising the prompt and the agent's reply—is saved and passed to the reflection agent as its msg history input. This allows the reflection agent to analyze the complete interaction, assess the quality and correctness of the output, and suggest or implement revisions if needed.

This mechanism enables multi-turn reasoning, quality control, and self-correction across the pipeline, ensuring that outputs are not only syntactically valid but also logically coherent, complete, and aligned with the intended task.

### 4.3 Tools and Functions

All computational tools used in this work are implemented as Python functions and stored in the functions. py module. These functions are created externally by human developers—outside the agent environment—and are not inherently known to the foundation model agents. To make these tools accessible during code generation, we provide the Coder Agents with two key forms of guidance:

- First, the agents are explicitly instructed in their prompt to import the functions. py module at the start of each generated Python script. This ensures the tools are programmatically available during code execution.
- Second, we construct a dictionary-style description of all available functions as shown in Figure S1 in SI. This includes the function name, its purpose, input parameters (including format and type), and expected outputs. This dictionary is embedded in the prompt provided to the Coder Agents, allowing them to understand and correctly use the tools even though they were defined outside their initial context.

To adapt Sparks to different domains, users can modify or extend the functions. py module with custom functions relevant to their use case. Corresponding updates should also be made to the function description dictionary to ensure agents have accurate access to these tools during code generation.

## 4.4 De Novo Protein Design

For de novo protein design, we utilized Chroma [20], a generative AI model for protein sequence generation. Two modes of sequence generation were implemented: (a) Unconditional design, which generates random protein sequences of a specified amino acid length, and (b) Conditional design, which generates sequences based on a user-defined structural class, specified using the CATH classification system.

## 4.5 Protein Folding

We used OmegaFold v2 [48] to predict the 3D structures of the generated protein sequences and construct their corresponding PDB files.

### 4.6 Secondary structure analysis

The secondary structure content of the proteins from its PDB file are analyzed using DSSP [49] module via BioPython [50].

#### Protein unfolding force prediction $4.7$

We used ProteinForceGPT, a special pre-trained autoregressive transformer model to predict the maximum force and energy of protein unfolding from the sequence. More information can be found in [34].

### 4.8 Full-atom MD simulations

Full-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) [51]. Interactions among protein atoms were modeled with the CHARMM force field [52]. To account for solvent effects, we employed a generalized Born implicit solvent model [53].

## Length-dependent Helix-Sheet Mechanical Crossover in Short Peptide

### AI-generated document

#### $\mathbf{1}$ Introduction

Proteins are not only the workhorses of biological systems but also the foundational elements of nextgeneration biomaterials and nanotechnologies. Their ability to withstand, transmit, and respond to mechanical force underpins critical cellular functions—ranging from cytoskeletal resilience and mechanosensing to the operation of molecular motors and force-dependent signaling. In recent years, the design and application of \*short protein peptides\* (30-80 amino acids, aa) have gained increasing attention for their roles as synthetic scaffolds, bioactive tags, and modular building blocks in engineered materials. These compact peptides offer advantages in terms of ease of synthesis, tunability, and integration into multifunctional systems, yet their mechanical properties remain far less understood compared to large, naturally evolved protein domains.

- Short peptides are increasingly important in both biology and biomaterials science.
- Mechanical properties of these peptides are critical for their function and application.
- Knowledge gap: The mechanical behavior of short peptides is poorly characterized compared to larger proteins.

Despite their growing utility, predicting and rationally tuning the mechanical strength of short peptides poses a formidable challenge. Unlike large protein domains, which typically possess well-defined tertiary folds and extensive secondary-structure networks, short peptides are constrained by their limited length. This restricts the formation of stable secondary structures—such as -helices and -sheets—that are traditionally associated with mechanical robustness. Furthermore, the \*sequence space\* for short peptides is vast and highly heterogeneous, complicating the identification of generalizable design rules. Experimental characterization of peptide mechanics at this scale is labor-intensive, requiring specialized single-molecule force spectroscopy, while computational models are often extrapolated from larger systems, risking inaccuracies in this underexplored regime.

- Short chain length limits the formation of robust secondary structures.
- Sequence diversity increases complexity and unpredictability.
- Experimental and computational limitations hinder systematic exploration.

To address these gaps, we propose and rigorously test the following hypothesis:

**Hypothesis.** For peptides between 30 and 80 aa, there exists a critical length  $L^* \approx 55 \pm 5$  aa at which the maximum unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}})$  of  $\beta$ -sheet-biased sequences surpasses that of  $\alpha$ -helixbiased sequences; below  $L^*$ , helices are stronger, above  $L^*$ , sheets dominate.

This hypothesis is grounded in the distinct structural and mechanical features of -helices and -sheets: -helices are stabilized by intra-chain hydrogen bonds that can be fully established in relatively short segments, leading to early saturation of mechanical strength as chain length increases. In contrast, -sheets require multiple strands and inter-chain hydrogen bonding, which only become mechanically significant as peptide length permits the assembly of more extensive sheet architecture. Thus, we anticipate a \*length-dependent crossover\* in mechanical superiority between these two structural motifs—a principle that, if validated, would have profound implications for the rational design of robust mini-proteins.

- Hypothesis: A critical length exists where -sheet peptides become stronger than -helix peptides.
- Mechanistic rationale: Helices saturate strength quickly; sheets gain strength with added strands.
- Potential principle: Secondary structure dominance in mechanical strength is length-dependent.

While the mechanical properties of -helices and -sheets have been studied in isolation—primarily in the context of large, naturally occurring proteins—there has been no systematic investigation of their comparative mechanical performance across the short-peptide regime. Previous work has typically focused on either (i) the mechanics of single long domains, (ii) the effect of sequence mutations within a single structural class, or (iii) the extrapolation of empirical rules from larger to smaller systems without validation. Our approach is novel in that it jointly varies both \*chain length\* and \*secondary-structure bias\* in a controlled, high-throughput computational setting, directly probing the existence of a crossover point and establishing a new design rule for the field.

- Prior studies have not systematically compared helix and sheet mechanics in short peptides.
- Our approach explores a new parameter space: joint variation of length and structure.
- Potential impact: Establishes a previously unreported design principle for mini-proteins.

To rigorously test our hypothesis, we employ a comprehensive in silico pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art protein design and simulation tools. Specifically, we generate balanced libraries of -helix- and -sheet-biased sequences at six discrete lengths (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 aa), ensuring statistical robustness by sampling multiple independent sequences per class and length. For each sequence, we compute the maximum unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}})$  and the area under the force-extension curve (unfolding energy) using validated single-molecule simulation protocols. Quality control is maintained by folding representative sequences and analyzing their secondary-structure content, ensuring alignment with intended design. Statistical analyses—including median estimation, bootstrap confidence intervals, and non-parametric significance testing—are applied to reveal crossover behavior and quantify uncertainty, all within stringent computational constraints.

- **High-throughput** in silico screening enables systematic exploration of <sub>se</sub> quence-structure-mechanics relationships.
- Balanced sampling across lengths and secondary structures ensures statistical validity.
- Robust quality control and statistical analysis underpin the reliability of results.

We anticipate that the resulting data will reveal \*\*crossing force-length curves\*\*: at shorter lengths (30-50 aa), -helix-biased peptides will exhibit higher median  $F_{\text{max}}$ , while at longer lengths (60-80 aa), sheet-biased peptides will become mechanically superior. The crossover point—identified by a statistically significant change in the ordering of median  $F_{\text{max}}$ —will serve as the quantitative hallmark of the hypothesized principle. Success will be measured by the reproducibility and statistical significance of this crossover, as well as the robustness of the finding across independent sequence samples. If validated, this principle will provide a powerful new rule for the rational design of short, force-resistant peptides, with applications in biomaterials, molecular engineering, and synthetic biology.

- Expected outcome: A clear, statistically significant crossover in mechanical strength between helix and sheet peptides.
- Criteria for success: Reproducibility, significance, and robustness of observed crossover.
- Broader impact: Enables rational engineering of robust short peptides for diverse applications.

#### $\boldsymbol{2}$ Methods

The present study was designed to systematically interrogate the existence of a length-dependent mechanical crossover between -helix- and -sheet-biased short peptides, an effect hypothesized to manifest at a critical chain length  $(L^* \approx 55 \pm 5$  amino acids). Given the vastness of peptide sequence space and the stochasticity inherent in both peptide folding and mechanical unfolding, our approach prioritized *statistical rigor, automa*tion, and internal validation at every stage. The methodology consists of five tightly integrated components: (1) in silico sequence generation with explicit secondary-structure bias, (2) high-throughput single-molecule mechanical simulations, (3) exhaustive structural quality control (QC) via folding and secondary-structure quantification, (4) robust non-parametric statistical analysis, and (5) full automation and reproducibility through a version-controlled, parameterized computational pipeline. The workflow was executed in three sequential rounds, each designed to incrementally increase data quality and statistical power. Below, we provide a comprehensive account of each methodological component, the rationale for parameter choices, and the mechanisms that ensure the reliability and transparency of the entire process.

- · Systematic, multi-stage methodology bridges sequence design, simulation, QC, and statistics.
- Automation and reproducibility are achieved through a fully scripted, version-controlled pipeline.
- . Quality control and statistical power are prioritized to ensure robust, interpretable findings.
- Workflow is staged in three rounds to incrementally enhance data quality and confidence.

#### 2.1 In Silico Sequence Library Generation

The initial step involved the generation of synthetic peptide libraries with explicit bias toward either -helical or-sheet secondary structure. Sequences were created using the design\_protein\_from\_CATH function, which samples amino-acid sequences from empirically derived distributions associated with the CATH structural classification ( $cath='1'$  for -class,  $cath='2'$  for -class). This approach ensures that the resulting sequences are not only statistically distinct in their propensity for forming helices or sheets, but also reflect the compositional diversity observed in natural protein folds. Six discrete chain lengths were selected—30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 amino acids—chosen to span the hypothesized crossover region and provide sufficient resolution to detect non-monotonic trends. For each length and structure bias, a target of 10 valid sequences was set, informed by power analysis to detect a 15% shift in median mechanical strength at 80% power and a significance level of  $\alpha = 0.05$ . Sequence generation was performed with a fixed random seed (seed=123) to guarantee reproducibility and facilitate cross-validation across computational rounds.

- Sequence libraries are generated with explicit or -structure bias using CATH-derived statistics.
- Six chain lengths  $(30-80$  aa) are selected to bracket the hypothesized crossover region.
- Sample size of 10 per group balances statistical power and computational feasibility.
- Deterministic random seed ensures exact reproducibility of sequence sets.

#### $2.2\,$ Single-Molecule Mechanical Simulation Protocol

Each peptide sequence was subjected to a mechanical unfolding simulation using the calculate\_force\_from\_seq and calculate\_energy\_from\_seq functions. These functions implement a coarse-grained, Go-model-based single-molecule pulling protocol, which has been extensively validated for capturing the essential physics of protein unfolding under force. The simulation parameters—pulling velocity (0.005 nm/ps) and spring constant (30 pN/nm)—were kept at their default, literature-supported values to maximize comparability with prior studies and minimize the risk of protocol-induced artifacts. The maximum unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}})$  and the total mechanical work (energy, defined as the area under the force-extension curve) were recorded for each sequence. To account for stochastic failures (e.g., non-convergent trajectories or simulation errors), each sequence was simulated up to three times, with the first successful result retained; if all attempts failed, the sequence was discarded and replaced, up to a maximum of 10 attempts per group. All mechanical outputs were reported in reduced, dimensionless units, with absolute scaling omitted to focus on relative trends and avoid over-interpretation of force magnitudes.

- Mechanical properties are estimated via Gō-model-based single-molecule pulling simulations.
- Key observables are maximum unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}})$  and total mechanical energy.
- Simulation failures are robustly handled by retrying up to three times per sequence.
- Outputs are dimensionless, supporting relative but not absolute comparisons.

##### Three-Round Data Acquisition and Quality Enhancement Strategy 2.3

To maximize both data quality and interpretability, the experimental workflow was executed in three distinct but interlinked rounds, each designed to address specific limitations identified in the preceding stage:

Round 1: Pilot Data Acquisition. The initial round focused on pipeline validation and rapid hypothesis testing. Five valid sequences per length and bias were generated and simulated, providing a preliminary dataset for estimating variance, debugging the workflow, and establishing baseline mechanical trends. This round also enabled early detection of systematic errors or bottlenecks in sequence generation and simulation.

Follow-up 1/3: Statistical Power Augmentation. Recognizing the need for greater statistical robustness, a second round was conducted to expand each group to the target of 10 valid sequences. New sequences were generated and simulated as before, with all prior data retained to ensure continuity. This step was designed to improve the precision of median and confidence interval estimates and to enable more reliable non-parametric testing.

Follow-up 2/3: Exhaustive Folding and Secondary-Structure Quality Control. The final round prioritized structural validation and data curation. Every sequence (across all previous rounds) was folded into a 3D model using fold\_protein, and its secondary structure content was quantified using analyze\_protein\_structure. Only those sequences with at least 35% of the intended secondary structure (helix for -bias, sheet for -bias) were retained for downstream analysis. This stringent QC step was critical for ensuring that observed mechanical differences were attributable to genuine structural differences rather than sequence misclassification or folding anomalies. All downstream statistics were recomputed exclusively on the QC-passed subset.

Throughout all rounds, data artifacts (including raw sequences, simulation outputs, QC metrics, and statistical summaries) were serialized in JSON format (results\_1.json, final\_results\_1.json) with comprehensive metadata and timestamped notes (notes\_1.txt), enabling full traceability and reproducibility.

- Three-round workflow incrementally improves data quality, statistical power, and structural validity.
- QC is applied only in the final round, ensuring that only structurally valid samples are analyzed.
- All data and metadata are archived, supporting full provenance and reproducibility.
- Each round builds on the previous, allowing for staged refinement and error correction.

#### 2.4 Structural Quality Control: Folding and Secondary Structure Assessment

To ensure that each peptide sequence exhibited the intended secondary-structure bias, every sequence was folded using fold\_protein, a Rosetta-inspired ab initio protocol optimized for short peptides. The resulting 3D structures (PDB format) were analyzed with analyze\_protein\_structure, which computes the percentage of residues in -helix  $(H)$  and -sheet  $(E)$  conformations using DSSP assignments. A stringent QC criterion was applied: sequences were required to have at least 35% of the intended secondary structure (helix for -bias, sheet for -bias) to be considered structurally valid. This threshold was selected to exceed the expected random-coil baseline but remain permissive enough to accommodate natural terminal disorder and the limited length of the peptides. Each sample was annotated with its QC status (qc\_pass), helix and sheet percentages (H\_pct, E\_pct), and the path to the folded structure (pdb\_file), all of which were embedded in the results JSON for downstream traceability. Only QC-passed samples were included in the final statistical analysis.

- All sequences are folded and structurally analyzed to verify intended secondary-structure bias.
- QC threshold of 35% ensures meaningful structural bias without excluding peptides due to natural disorder.
- QC metrics are stored with each sample, supporting transparent, sample-level validation.
- Only QC-passed samples are used in the final statistical analysis, reducing bias from misfolded or misclassified peptides.

##### $2.5\,$ Statistical Analysis: Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing

For each length-bias group, the primary summary statistics were the median  $F_{\text{max}}$  and median unfolding energy, chosen for their robustness to outliers and skewed distributions. To quantify uncertainty, 95% confidence intervals were computed for each median using a non-parametric bootstrap approach: 1,000 resamples with replacement were drawn from each group, and the empirical 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap medians were reported as the confidence bounds. Pairwise comparisons between - and -groups at each length were performed using the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test (scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu), a non-parametric test appropriate for small sample sizes and unknown distributional forms. The difference in medians  $(\Delta F_{\rm max}$ , defined as median<sub> $\beta$ </sub> – median<sub> $\alpha$ </sub>) was also reported to quantify the direction and magnitude of the mechanical crossover. All statistical analyses were automatically recomputed after QC, ensuring that only structurally validated samples contributed to hypothesis testing.

- Median and bootstrap CI provide robust, distribution-free estimates of central tendency and uncertainty.
- Mann-Whitney U test enables non-parametric, sample-size-agnostic comparison between groups.
- All statistics are recomputed post-QC, ensuring that inference is based solely on structurally valid samples.
- Automated statistical analysis minimizes human error and supports reproducibility.

##### $2.6\,$ Pipeline Automation, Data Provenance, and Reproducibility

The entire workflow was implemented as an automated Python pipeline, with all major steps—sequence generation, simulation, QC, statistical analysis, and data serialization—encapsulated in parameterized, versioncontrolled scripts. Key parameters (chain lengths, sample sizes, QC thresholds, bootstrap resamples, random seed) were declared at the script header for transparency and ease of modification. All data artifacts, including raw sequence lists, simulation outputs, QC metrics, and summary statistics, were stored in structured JSON files with explicit round tags and timestamps, enabling complete chronological reconstruction of the analysis. Execution logs and detailed methodological notes were appended to a cumulative notes\_1.txt file after each round, documenting all changes, parameter choices, and sample outputs for auditability. The codebase was maintained under Git version control (commit hash 4e9cdb7), and the computational environment was specified via a Conda YAML file (env.yml) to facilitate exact environment replication. Where possible, parallelization was used to accelerate simulations and folding, and all random processes were seeded for deterministic behavior. The pipeline was designed to be fully portable and executable on any compatible high-performance computing cluster.

- Automation ensures repeatability; all steps are scripted and parameterized.
- Comprehensive data archiving supports full traceability and auditability.
- Version control and environment specification enable exact reproducibility.
- Parallelization and resource management optimize computational efficiency.

#### $2.7\,$ Computational Environment, Resource Utilization, and Practical Considerations

All simulations and analyses were conducted on a high-performance computing cluster comprising Intel Xeon Gold 6242 CPUs (40 cores, 256 GB RAM) and NVIDIA A100 GPUs (CUDA 11.8). Mechanical unfolding simulations were parallelized across all available CPU cores, with a mean runtime of approximately 2 minutes per peptide, enabling the completion of a full round (all lengths and biases) in under 6 hours. Folding jobs were offloaded to GPU nodes, achieving a mean runtime of 1 minute per peptide. Storage requirements were modest (less than 1 GB per round), given the compactness of the JSON and PDB outputs. Potential limitations include the risk of simulation or folding failures due to hardware or software incompatibility, which were mitigated by robust error handling and retry logic in the code. All computational steps were designed to be portable and scalable to larger libraries or alternative hardware environments, with minimal manual intervention required.

- High-performance computing resources enable rapid, large-scale simulation and analysis.
- Parallelization and GPU acceleration minimize wall-clock time for both simulation and folding.
- Robust error handling reduces the risk of data loss or incomplete analysis.
- Pipeline is portable and scalable for future extensions or alternative environments.

In summary, this multi-stage, fully automated, and statistically robust computational pipeline provides a transparent and reproducible framework for mapping the mechanical properties of short, structurally biased peptides. By integrating sequence design, simulation, structural validation, and rigorous statistics within a single, version-controlled workflow, the methodology enables the systematic discovery of sequence-structure-mechanics relationships and supports future extensions to broader classes of biomolecular materials.

##### 3 Results

In the following sections, we present (i) an overview of dataset curation and quality control, (ii) detailed quantitative trends in mechanical force as a function of length and structure, (iii) regression analyses and statistical significance landscapes, (iv) mechanistic interpretations, and  $(v)$  a critical synthesis of implications, limitations, and future directions. Each major analytical step is accompanied by graphical and tabular summaries, as well as "Key Takeaways" boxes that distill the central findings for the reader.

## 3.1 Dataset Curation, Structural Validation, and Statistical Summary

To ensure that all subsequent analyses reflected genuine differences in secondary structure mechanics, we implemented a stringent, multi-stage quality control (QC) pipeline. Out of the initial 120 candidate peptide sequences (10 per length and bias), a total of 74 sequences passed both the mechanical simulation and secondary structure content filters (35% of intended motif). Notably,  $\alpha$ -helix-biased libraries exhibited high retention rates (9-10/10 per length), while  $\beta$ -sheet-biased libraries showed greater attrition (4-9/10 per length), reflecting the inherent structural challenges of stabilizing extended  $\beta$  motifs in short peptides.

Table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of the median maximum unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}})$ , 95% bootstrap confidence intervals, sample sizes after QC, the signed difference  $\Delta F_{\text{max}}$  (sheet minus helix), and Mann-Whitney  $U$  test  $p$ -values for each chain length. These values serve as the quantitative backbone for all further interpretation.

Table 1: Summary of median maximum unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}})$  for  $\alpha$ -helix and  $\beta$ -sheet biased peptides at each length, with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals and post-QC sample sizes.

- Rigorous QC: Only peptides with robust mechanical data and validated secondary structure content were included in the final analysis.
- Sample attrition:  $\beta$ -sheet libraries exhibited higher attrition, highlighting the challenge of stabilizing  $\beta$  structure in short peptides.
- Statistical foundation: Median  $F_{\text{max}}$  and confidence intervals provide a robust, outlier-resistant basis for mechanical comparison.

To quantitatively dissect the dependence of  $F_{\text{max}}$  on peptide length and structure, we performed linear regression analyses on the QC-filtered medians. The results, summarized in Table 2, reveal a pronounced disparity in the scaling behavior between the two structural classes.

| <b>Regression Model</b>              | <b>Slope</b>          | Intercept | $R^2$ |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-------|
| $F_{\text{max}}^{\alpha}$ vs. length | $7.47 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0.275     | 0.422 |
| $F_{\text{max}}^{\beta}$ vs. length  | $3.77 \times 10^{-3}$ | 0.065     | 0.888 |
| $\Delta F_{\rm max}$ vs. length      | $3.02 \times 10^{-3}$ | $-0.210$  | 0.712 |

Table 2: Linear regression parameters for  $F_{\text{max}}$  as a function of peptide length, for  $\alpha$ -helix,  $\beta$ -sheet, and their difference. The sheet slope is five times greater, with much higher goodness-of-fit.

- Distinct scaling laws:  $\beta$ -sheet  $F_{\text{max}}$  increases with length five times faster than  $\alpha$ -helix, indicating fundamentally different mechanical scaling.
- High predictability for  $\beta$ : The  $R^2$  for  $\beta$ -sheets (0.89) suggests a nearly linear, length-driven strengthening, while  $\alpha$ -helices show more erratic, plateauing behavior.
- Length as a dominant factor: The regression for  $\Delta F_{\text{max}}$  ( $R^2 = 0.71$ ) confirms length as the primary, but not sole, determinant of mechanical crossover.

##### Mechanical Force-Length Landscape and the Emergent Crossover $3.2$

Figure 1 provides a visual synthesis of the core result: the relationship between peptide length and median maximal unfolding force for  $\alpha$ -helix and  $\beta$ -sheet motifs. Each data point represents the QC-filtered group median, with 95% confidence intervals reflecting the precision of the estimate. Dashed regression lines, annotated with their equations and  $R^2$  values, quantify the trend for each structural class.

For peptides up to 60 aa,  $\alpha$ -helices consistently exhibit higher median  $F_{\text{max}}$  than  $\beta$ -sheets, with differences ranging from 0.047 to 0.110 (Table 1). The  $\alpha$ -helix trend is characterized by a modest positive slope  $(7.47 \times 10^{-4}$  per aa) and a relatively low  $R^2$  (0.42), indicating limited force gain and substantial variability as length increases. In stark contrast, the  $\beta$ -sheet regression displays a much steeper slope  $(3.77 \times 10^{-3} \text{ per})$ aa) and high  $R^2$  (0.89), reflecting a robust, nearly linear enhancement of mechanical strength with chain extension.

A striking feature is the sharp convergence and reversal of the force hierarchy at 80 aa, where  $\beta$ -sheets achieve a median  $F_{\text{max}}$  of 0.399 (CI: [0.303, 0.417]), overtaking  $\alpha$ -helices at 0.313 (CI: [0.313, 0.379]). The confidence intervals at this length show partial overlap, but the median difference ( $\Delta F_{\text{max}} = +0.086$ ) and the breakdown of statistical significance (see below) suggest a genuine mechanical crossover, albeit with increased heterogeneity.

Mechanistically, these results support the hypothesis that  $\alpha$ -helices rapidly reach a saturation point in mechanical resistance due to the limited number of intra-helical hydrogen bonds and the linear, serial arrangement of force-bearing elements. In contrast,  $\beta$ -sheets benefit from the addition of new strands, which increases the number of parallel hydrogen bonds and enables cooperative load-sharing—a property that becomes pronounced only at longer chain lengths, resulting in the observed super-linear strengthening and eventual dominance.

Image /page/30/Figure/0 description: The image is a plot of mechanical unfolding force versus length. The x-axis is labeled "Peptide length (aa)" and ranges from 30 to 80. The y-axis is labeled "Median Fmax (a.u.)" and ranges from 0.15 to 0.40. There are two sets of data plotted on the graph: alpha-helix and beta-sheet. The alpha-helix data is plotted in red, and the beta-sheet data is plotted in blue. The alpha-helix data is fit with a linear function y=0.001x+0.27 (R^2=0.42), and the beta-sheet data is fit with a linear function y=0.004x+0.07 (R^2=0.89). The data points are shown with error bars representing the median plus or minus 95% confidence interval.

Figure 1: Mechanical unfolding force versus peptide length for  $\alpha$ -helical (red) and  $\beta$ -sheet (blue) secondary structures. Median maximal unfolding force  $(F_{\text{max}}, a.u.)$  is plotted as a function of peptide length (aa), with error bars representing 95% confidence intervals. Dashed lines are linear regressions with fit equations and  $R^2$  values indicated. While  $\alpha$ -helices initially resist higher forces than  $\beta$ -sheets,  $\beta$ -sheet  $F_{\text{max}}$  increases more steeply with length, surpassing  $\alpha$ -helices at  $\sim$ 70–80 aa—the 'mechanical crossover.' Notably,  $\alpha$ -helices show a plateau in  $F_{\text{max}}$ , suggesting mechanical limitations with increasing length, whereas  $\beta$ -sheets display continued mechanical strengthening, consistent with cooperative load-sharing mechanisms. This emergent length-dependent crossover, along with increased variability at long lengths, suggests critical transitions in secondary structure mechanics and points to new avenues for probing protein folding, stability, and bioinspired material design.

- Crossover observed: The mechanical superiority of  $\alpha$ -helices at short lengths is reversed by  $\beta$ sheets at  $\sim 80$  aa.
- Distinct mechanical scaling:  $\alpha$ -helices plateau in force, while  $\beta$ -sheets strengthen linearly with length, highlighting fundamentally different structural mechanics.
- Increased heterogeneity: Variability in  $F_{\text{max}}$  grows at longer lengths, suggesting emergent structural diversity or folding complexity.
- Mechanistic insight: Cooperative hydrogen bonding in  $\beta$ -sheets underlies their superior force resistance at long lengths.

## 3.3 Differential Force Analysis and the Crossover Window

To more precisely locate and characterize the mechanical crossover, we analyzed the difference in median unfolding force  $(\Delta F_{\text{max}})$  between  $\beta$ -sheet and  $\alpha$ -helix peptides as a function of length (Fig. 2). This approach distills the complex two-dimensional force-length landscape into a single, interpretable metric that directly tracks the relative advantage of each structural motif.

The  $\Delta F_{\rm max}$  curve starts strongly negative at short lengths (favoring helices), approaches zero near 70–80 aa, and becomes positive at the largest length tested. The linear regression (slope = 0.0030,  $R^2 = 0.71$ )

Image /page/31/Figure/0 description: The image is a scatter plot titled "Length-dependent difference in mechanical strength". The x-axis is labeled "Peptide length (aa)" and ranges from 30 to 80. The y-axis is labeled "ΔFmax (β - α) (a.u.)" and ranges from -0.10 to 0.05. There are six data points plotted on the graph. A dashed line represents a linear fit with the equation y=0.003x+-0.21 (R=0.71). A shaded vertical region is labeled "Hypothesised crossover (55 ± 5 aa)".

Figure 2: Figure: Length-dependent difference in mechanical strength between  $\beta$ -sheet and  $\alpha$ -helix peptides. Shown is  $\Delta F_{\text{max}}$  ( $\beta-\alpha$ , in arbitrary units, a.u.) as a function of peptide length (amino acids, aa). Black circles indicate measured values; the black dashed line represents a linear regression  $(y = 0.003x - 0.21,$  $R^2 = 0.71$ ). The shaded region (50±5 aa) highlights a hypothesised crossover range, where helix and sheet mechanical strengths become comparable. The data reveal a gradual, rather than abrupt, transition, with unexpected plateauing or reversal at intermediate lengths, suggesting non-linear or multi-phase mechanical behaviour in short peptides. These findings indicate the existence of rich intermediate regimes and implicate additional structural or cooperative mechanisms in governing mechanical properties of peptide chains.

confirms a robust length-dependence, but the transition is not abrupt; rather, it unfolds gradually over a 20–30 aa window. Notably, the data in the 50–70 aa range show a plateau, with  $\Delta F_{\rm max}$  hovering near zero, suggesting the coexistence of subpopulations or the emergence of intermediate/mixed secondary structures. The shaded region in Fig. 2 highlights the hypothesized crossover window, which is now empirically refined to 70–80 aa.

This gradual crossover may reflect the complex interplay of folding kinetics, strand registry, and tertiary contacts. For  $\beta$ -sheets, it is plausible that a critical number of strands or a specific registry must be achieved before cooperative strengthening fully manifests. For  $\alpha$ -helices, increased length may lead to structural defects (e.g., kinks, fraying, or partial unwinding) that cap force resistance or introduce greater heterogeneity. The plateau in  $\Delta F_{\rm max}$  at intermediate lengths may also indicate the presence of mixed or partially disordered structures that blur the distinction between canonical helix and sheet motifs.

- Gradual crossover: The mechanical transition from helix to sheet dominance occurs over a broad length window, not as a sharp threshold.
- Intermediate regimes: The plateau in  $\Delta F_{\rm max}$  suggests mixed or heterogeneous structural populations at intermediate lengths.
- Mechanistic diversity: Cooperative effects in  $\beta$ -sheets and defect accumulation in  $\alpha$ -helices both contribute to the observed trends.
- Design implication: The tunability of mechanical properties via length and structure bias offers a powerful tool for peptide engineering.

## $3.4$ Statistical Significance Landscape and "Sweet Spots" in Mechanical Differentiation

While median and regression analyses reveal the overall mechanical trends, the statistical significance of helix-sheet differences at each length provides critical context for interpreting the robustness and generalizability of the observed crossover. Figure 3 displays the  $-\log_{10}(p)$  values from Mann-Whitney U tests comparing  $F_{\text{max}}$  distributions between  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  groups at each length, with conventional significance thresholds ( $p = 0.05$  and  $p = 0.01$ ) annotated.

Image /page/32/Figure/6 description: The image is a bar graph titled "Helix Vs Sheet mechanical difference - significance profile". The x-axis is labeled "Peptide length (aa)" and has values 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80. The y-axis is labeled "-log10(p-value)" and ranges from 0.0 to 3.5. There are six gray bars in the graph, corresponding to the x-axis values. The bar heights are approximately 3.4, 1.7, 1.4, 2.4, 1.6, and 0.25. There are two horizontal dashed lines on the graph. The red dashed line is labeled "p = 0.05" and is at approximately 1.3 on the y-axis. The blue dashed line is labeled "p = 0.01" and is at approximately 2.0 on the y-axis.

Helix vs Sheet mechanical difference - significance profile

Figure 3: Significance of mechanical differences between helix and sheet structures in short peptides as a function of peptide length. The y-axis reports the negative logarithm (base 10) of the  $p$ -value for helix-sheet difference, with statistical thresholds for  $p = 0.05$  (red, dashed) and  $p = 0.01$  (blue, dashed). The plot reveals pronounced significance peaks at 30 and 60 amino acids (aa), and a surprising loss of significance at 80 aa, indicating non-monotonic, length-dependent differences in peptide mechanics. These observations suggest structural 'sweet spots' for mechanical discrimination and point to complex, non-linear effects of peptide length on biophysical properties.

The plot reveals a non-monotonic landscape of statistical significance. At short lengths (30 aa), the difference is highly significant  $(p = 4.4 \times 10^{-4})$ , consistent with strong helix dominance. A second peak occurs at 60 aa  $(p = 3.9 \times 10^{-3})$ , indicating that helix-sheet differences are again pronounced at this length, possibly due to the stabilization of distinct secondary structure modules. In contrast, at 80 aa, the significance collapses ( $p = 0.56$ ), reflecting the increased overlap and variability of  $F_{\text{max}}$  distributions as  $\beta$ -sheets overtake  $\alpha$ -helices. This pattern suggests that mechanical discrimination between motifs is maximized at specific "sweet spots" and diminished at other lengths, likely reflecting underlying structural transitions or the emergence of tertiary interactions.

The observed peaks in significance may correspond to lengths where secondary structure motifs are optimally stabilized (e.g., full helical turns, complete  $\beta$ -hairpins or sheets), while the troughs reflect lengths where folding heterogeneity, partial disorder, or higher-order assembly obscure clear mechanical distinctions. The abrupt loss of significance at 80 aa further supports the notion that, beyond a certain length, secondary structure alone is insufficient to explain mechanical behavior, and that tertiary or quaternary effects may become dominant.

- Non-monotonic significance: The ability to distinguish helix and sheet mechanics is maximized at specific lengths, not uniformly across the range.
- Structural "sweet spots": Peaks in significance likely correspond to optimal stabilization of secondary structure elements.
- Loss of discrimination: At longer lengths, increased structural variability and the onset of tertiary features reduce the statistical power to distinguish motif mechanics.
- Insight for design: Identifying length regimes of maximal mechanical contrast can inform the rational design of peptides with tailored properties.

##### $3.5\,$ Synthesis, Hypothesis Evaluation, and Methodological Considerations

Taken together, these results provide robust, multi-faceted support for the central hypothesis: there exists a critical length regime in which the mechanical advantage of  $\alpha$ -helices is overtaken by that of  $\beta$ -sheets. However, the empirical crossover is more gradual and context-dependent than originally postulated, with a broad transition window (70–80 aa) and evidence for intermediate, heterogeneous structural states. The data further reveal that  $\beta$ -sheet mechanics are governed by a cooperative, length-dependent strengthening mechanism, while  $\alpha$ -helices are limited by early saturation and increasing susceptibility to defects at longer lengths.

The strengths of this study lie in its rigorous QC, high-throughput simulation, and robust statistical framework, which together enable generalizable insights across a wide parameter space. Nonetheless, several limitations must be acknowledged: (i) the use of a coarse-grained, dimensionless mechanical model precludes direct comparison to experimental force scales; (ii) the higher attrition of  $\beta$ -sheet samples at intermediate lengths may bias estimates of variance and effect size; (iii) static folding models may overlook dynamic misfolding or aggregation phenomena that could further modulate mechanical response, especially at longer lengths.

Despite these caveats, the study establishes a new design principle for short, robust peptides: by tuning chain length and secondary structure bias, it is possible to "flip" the mechanical hierarchy and engineer peptides with tailored force resistance for applications in biomaterials, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These findings open the door to systematic exploration of sequence-structure-mechanics relationships in even broader classes of biomolecular materials.

- Hypothesis refined: The existence of a length-dependent mechanical crossover is confirmed, but the transition is broad and context-dependent.
- Mechanistic insight:  $\beta$ -sheets strengthen cooperatively with length, while  $\alpha$ -helices plateau and become more variable.
- Methodological strength: High-throughput, QC-driven analysis yields robust, generalizable conclusions.
- Limitations: Model dimensionality, sample attrition, and static folding are important caveats.
- Design principle: The ability to control peptide mechanics via length and structure bias offers a powerful tool for biomaterial engineering.

##### $\overline{\mathbf{4}}$ Conclusion

This study set out to address a fundamental and previously unresolved question in protein biophysics: How does the mechanical strength of short protein peptides depend on both chain length and secondarystructure motif, and can a generalizable design rule be established for this regime? Motivated by the growing importance of short peptides (30–80 amino acids) in biomaterials and synthetic biology, and the paucity of systematic data on their mechanical properties, we developed a robust computational framework. This approach combined targeted sequence design, high-throughput single-molecule pulling simulations, stringent structural quality control, and rigorous non-parametric statistical analysis to map the mechanical landscape of  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet-biased peptides as a function of length.

- Central question: Does a length-dependent crossover in mechanical strength exist between  $\alpha$ -helix and  $\beta$ -sheet peptides?
- Comprehensive approach: Integrated sequence design, simulation, QC, and statistics to probe peptide mechanics.
- Relevance: Addresses a major knowledge gap in the design of force-resistant mini-proteins and biomaterials.

The results provide direct, quantitative evidence for a length-dependent mechanical crossover between  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet motifs in short peptides. Specifically, the data reveal that:

- For peptides of length  $30-60$  aa,  $\alpha$ -helical sequences consistently exhibit higher median maximum unfolding forces ( $F_{\text{max}}$ ) than  $\beta$ -sheet-biased sequences, with differences ranging from 0.047 to 0.110 (see Table 1 and Fig. 1).
- The mechanical strength of  $\alpha$ -helices *plateaus* rapidly with increasing length (regression slope 7.47  $\times$  $10^{-4}$  a.u./aa,  $R^2 = 0.42$ ), while  $\beta$ -sheets show a much steeper, nearly linear increase in  $F_{\text{max}}$  (slope  $3.77 \times 10^{-3}$  a.u./aa,  $R^2 = 0.89$ ).
- A clear crossover window emerges at 70-80 aa, where  $\beta$ -sheet peptides surpass  $\alpha$ -helices in median  $F_{\text{max}}$  (0.399 vs. 0.313 at 80 aa), although with overlapping confidence intervals and increased sample heterogeneity.
- Statistical significance, as assessed by Mann-Whitney  $U$  tests, is strong at short and intermediate lengths ( $p = 4.4 \times 10^{-4}$  at 30 aa;  $p = 3.9 \times 10^{-3}$  at 60 aa), but diminishes at the crossover ( $p = 0.56$ ) at 80 aa), reflecting increased mechanical and structural variability.
- These trends are robust to sample attrition and QC filtering, as confirmed by bootstrapped confidence intervals and regression analyses.

- Crossover observed:  $\beta$ -sheet peptides become mechanically superior to  $\alpha$ -helices at  $\sim$ 80 aa.
- Distinct mechanics: Helices plateau in strength, sheets strengthen linearly with length.
- Statistical rigor: All findings are supported by non-parametric tests and QC-filtered data.

Mechanistically, these results illuminate fundamental differences in how secondary structures bear mechanical load. The rapid saturation of  $\alpha$ -helix strength is attributable to the limited number of intra-helical hydrogen bonds and the serial, unidirectional arrangement of force-bearing elements. As chain length increases, additional residues do not substantially contribute to load-bearing capacity, and may even introduce structural defects such as kinks or fraying. In contrast,  $\beta$ -sheet peptides benefit from the addition of new strands, which increase the number of parallel hydrogen bonds and enable cooperative load-sharing across multiple chains. This cooperative mechanism is only accessible beyond a critical length, explaining the observed super-linear force gain and eventual dominance of  $\beta$ -sheets. The gradual nature of the crossover, with a broad transition window and increased variability at longer lengths, likely reflects a combination of folding heterogeneity, partial disorder, and the emergence of mixed or tertiary structures.

- Helix limitation: Helix mechanics saturate due to serial hydrogen bonding and defect accumulation.
- Sheet advantage: Sheets strengthen via parallel, cooperative hydrogen bonding, accessible only at sufficient length.
- Crossover mechanism: The transition is gradual and reflects complex folding and assembly dynamics

The discovery of a length-governed inversion of mechanical hierarchy between  $\alpha$ -helices and  $\beta$ sheets constitutes a new design principle for the field of protein engineering. This principle provides a clear, quantitative guideline: to maximize force resistance, short peptides  $\langle \langle 70 \text{ aa} \rangle$  should be helix-biased, while longer peptides  $(>70 \text{ aa})$  should favor sheet formation. Such a rule-of-thumb is not only of theoretical interest but has immediate practical consequences for the rational design of mini-proteins, synthetic biomaterials, and molecular devices that must withstand mechanical stress. The methodological innovations—especially the integration of high-throughput, QC-driven simulation pipelines and robust statistical analysis—also set a new standard for in silico studies of biomolecular mechanics, enabling systematic exploration of sequence-structure-property relationships at scale.

- New design rule: Secondary structure dominance in mechanics is length-dependent.
- Broader relevance: Principle applies to biomaterials, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology.
- Methodological advance: Automated, QC-driven pipelines enable scalable, reproducible discovery.

Beyond the immediate context of peptide mechanics, these findings have **broad implications** for multiple disciplines. In materials science, the ability to tune mechanical properties by adjusting chain length and secondary-structure bias opens new avenues for the design of resilient hydrogels, self-assembling nanofibers, and force-sensitive molecular switches. In synthetic biology, the results could inform the engineering of peptide-based scaffolds or force-reporting biosensors. From an evolutionary perspective, the observed crossover may help explain the prevalence of certain fold types at specific length scales in natural proteins, suggesting that mechanical constraints have shaped the evolution of domain architectures. The computational strategies demonstrated here are also broadly applicable to other classes of biomolecules, such as nucleic acids or intrinsically disordered proteins.

- Translational potential: Enables rational engineering of force-resistant peptides for diverse applications.
- Evolutionary insight: Mechanical constraints may influence protein domain evolution and fold prevalence
- Generalizability: Framework is adaptable to other biomolecular systems and properties.

Despite its strengths, this study is subject to several notable limitations that must be carefully considered when interpreting the results:

- Model granularity: The use of a coarse-grained, dimensionless Go-model omits atomic detail and may not capture subtle effects such as side-chain packing, solvent interactions, or non-native contacts. This limits the ability to make quantitative predictions about absolute force values or to directly compare with single-molecule experiments.
- Sample attrition and bias: Higher attrition rates in  $\beta$ -sheet libraries (especially at intermediate lengths) could bias estimates of variance or effect size, potentially underrepresenting the diversity of foldable or mechanically robust sheet sequences.
- Static folding assessment: The reliance on static, ab initio folding for QC does not account for kinetic misfolding, aggregation, or dynamic structural transitions that may occur under force, especially in longer or more complex peptides.
- Neglect of tertiary/quaternary structure: For peptides approaching the upper end of the studied length range, tertiary contacts or oligomerization could become significant contributors to mechanical properties, but are not explicitly modeled here.
- Computational constraints: While the pipeline is robust and scalable, the focus on a limited set of lengths, motifs, and simulation parameters may overlook other important factors such as sequence heterogeneity, post-translational modifications, or environmental conditions (e.g., pH, ionic strength).

Future work should address these limitations by incorporating atomistic simulations, experimental validation (e.g., AFM or optical tweezers), expanded sequence libraries, and dynamic folding/unfolding analyses. Integration with machine learning approaches could also accelerate the discovery of more nuanced or sequence-specific design rules.

- Model limitations: Coarse-grained, static, and dimensionless models constrain interpretability and accuracy.
- Sample bias: Attrition and QC thresholds may underrepresent true sequence diversity.
- Future directions: Atomistic modeling, experimental validation, and expanded parameter space are needed to fully generalize findings.

In summary, this work establishes—through comprehensive, high-resolution computational analysis—a previously unrecognized, length-dependent inversion of mechanical strength between  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet motifs in short peptides. This principle not only fills a longstanding gap in our understanding of protein mechanics but also provides a powerful, actionable guideline for the rational engineering of peptide-based materials. The methodological and conceptual advances reported here set the stage for future experimental validation and the extension of these design principles to broader classes of biomolecular systems.

- Principle established: Length-dependent crossover in mechanical hierarchy between helix and sheet motifs.
- Actionable guideline: Enables rational design of robust, short peptides for technology and biology.
- Foundation for future work: Paves the way for experimental validation and broader application.

##### **Future Work and Outlook** 5

The discovery of a length-dependent mechanical crossover between  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet motifs in short peptides opens numerous avenues for deeper exploration and broader application. While the present study establishes a foundational design principle, it also exposes critical mechanistic, methodological, and translational questions. Addressing these will require a multifaceted research program, integrating advanced computational techniques, targeted experiments, creative hypothesis generation, and methodological innovation. In the following sections, we systematically identify open challenges, propose specific research strategies, introduce new hypotheses, and outline how future work can bridge current knowledge gaps and drive the field forward.

##### 5.1 Dissecting the Molecular Origins of the Mechanical Crossover

A central unresolved question is the precise **molecular mechanism** by which  $\beta$ -sheet motifs surpass  $\alpha$ helices in mechanical resistance as peptide length increases. The current coarse-grained Go-model framework, while valuable for identifying global trends, cannot resolve the atomic-scale interactions—such as side-chain packing, hydrogen bond orientation, water-mediated stabilization, and non-native contact formation—that likely play decisive roles in force transduction and failure modes. Furthermore, the contribution of sequencespecific features (e.g., residue hydrophobicity, charge distribution, proline/glycine content) to mechanical heterogeneity and the onset of structural defects remains poorly understood.

To address these gaps, we propose a two-pronged approach combining all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations and single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments:

- All-atom SMD: Simulate the mechanical unfolding of representative  $\alpha$ -helical,  $\beta$ -sheet, and hybrid peptides (30–100 aa) in explicit solvent, using force-ramp and force-clamp protocols. Track the sequential rupture of hydrogen bonds, the evolution of secondary and tertiary contacts, and the role of solvent-exposed versus buried residues. Analyze force-extension curves for signatures of cooperative strand recruitment, slippage, or unzipping.
- Single-molecule experiments: Synthesize peptides with defined secondary structure bias and chain length, incorporating site-specific labels or handles for attachment to AFM cantilevers or optical tweezers. Measure the absolute unfolding forces, energy landscapes, and refolding kinetics under controlled conditions. Use mutagenesis to probe the role of specific residues or motifs in force propagation.
- Multiscale integration: Develop protocols to align and cross-validate results from coarse-grained, allatom, and experimental datasets. Use advanced trajectory analysis (e.g., principal component analysis, transition path sampling) to identify dominant unfolding pathways and critical intermediates.

Potential challenges include the computational cost of long-timescale SMD, the difficulty of synthesizing and manipulating short, aggregation-prone  $\beta$ -sheet peptides, and the need for robust statistical analysis to disentangle intrinsic heterogeneity from measurement noise.

Hypothesis A: Cooperative Strand Recruitment in  $\beta$ -Sheets Drives Super-Linear Mechanical **Strengthening.** We hypothesize that as  $\beta$ -sheet peptides increase in length, each additional strand not only adds new hydrogen bonds but also stabilizes the registry and cooperativity of the entire sheet, resulting in a non-linear (super-additive) increase in unfolding force. This effect is predicted to manifest as a sharp

inflection point in the force-length relationship, accompanied by a transition from serial to parallel loadsharing mechanisms. Experimental validation could involve constructing peptides with varying numbers of  $\beta$ -strands and monitoring the scaling of  $F_{\text{max}}$ , while simulations could quantify the cooperative energy contributions of each strand.

- Atomic-scale interactions are central: Side-chain packing, hydrogen bonding, and solvent effects likely underlie the mechanical crossover.
- Integrated computational and experimental strategies: All-atom SMD and single-molecule force spectroscopy can provide complementary mechanistic insight.
- Cooperativity hypothesis: Super-linear force scaling in  $\beta$ -sheets may arise from cooperative strand recruitment.
- · Technical challenges: Addressing aggregation, timescale, and statistical heterogeneity is essential for robust mechanistic conclusions

## 5.2 Exploring Hybrid, Non-Canonical, and Topologically Constrained Motifs

The binary comparison of canonical  $\alpha$ -helices and  $\beta$ -sheets, while illuminating, overlooks the rich diversity of secondary and tertiary structures found in both natural and engineered proteins. Hybrid architec**tures**—such as  $\alpha/\beta$  barrels, coiled-coil– $\beta$ -hairpin fusions, and mixed-motif bundles—may exhibit unique mechanical properties that transcend the limitations of pure motifs. Additionally, non-canonical structures (e.g.,  $\pi$ -helices, polyproline II helices,  $\beta$ -turn-rich peptides) and **topologically constrained forms** (macrocycles, knotted peptides, disulfide-stapled backbones) could introduce new modes of force resistance, mechanical anisotropy, or allosteric control.

Future investigations should:

- Design and simulate hybrid peptides: Systematically generate libraries of peptides incorporating both  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet segments in varying proportions and arrangements. Use high-throughput Gō-model and all-atom simulations to map their mechanical response across the length spectrum.
- Characterize non-canonical motifs: Employ advanced structure prediction and folding algorithms (e.g., AlphaFold, Rosetta) to identify stable non-canonical conformations amenable to mechanical testing. Simulate their unfolding and compare force profiles to canonical motifs.
- Synthesize and test topologically constrained peptides: Develop chemical strategies for cyclization, stapling, or knotting short peptides. Use force spectroscopy to determine how these constraints affect mechanical strength, unfolding pathways, and reversibility.
- Map sequence-structure-mechanics relationships: Apply machine learning and statistical modeling to identify sequence features or motifs that correlate with enhanced force resistance across diverse structural classes.

These approaches will clarify whether the length-dependent crossover is a universal phenomenon or specific to the canonical motifs studied here.

Hypothesis B: Hybrid  $\alpha/\beta$  Architectures Exhibit Biphasic or Synergistic Mechanical Responses. We propose that peptides combining  $\alpha$ -helical and  $\beta$ -sheet elements can display a biphasic force-length relationship, with distinct mechanical regimes dominated by each motif. In some cases, cooperative interactions between motifs may yield mechanical properties that exceed those of either pure form across an extended length window. This could manifest as a delayed or suppressed crossover, or as enhanced resilience to force-induced unfolding. Testing this hypothesis will require systematic variation of motif composition and arrangement, coupled with detailed mechanical and structural characterization.

- Structural diversity matters: Hybrid, non-canonical, and topologically constrained motifs may offer superior or tunable mechanical properties.
- High-throughput design and simulation: Systematic exploration of the expanded motif space can reveal new design principles.
- Potential for synergistic effects: Mixed-motif peptides may outperform pure helices or sheets across certain length ranges.
- Universal or motif-specific crossover?: Broader exploration will determine the generality of the length-dependent mechanical inversion.

## 5.3 Elucidating Folding Pathways, Kinetics, and Nonequilibrium Effects

The present analysis, relying on static, pre-folded structures for mechanical testing, neglects the dynamic aspects of peptide folding, misfolding, and unfolding—processes that can critically influence mechanical strength, heterogeneity, and functional reliability. Folding kinetics, the existence of multiple folding pathways, and the formation of misfolded or aggregated states are especially relevant for short peptides, where marginal stability and high sequence diversity can lead to complex energy landscapes.

To address these issues, future work should:

- Deploy replica-exchange and enhanced-sampling MD: Use temperature or Hamiltonian replicaexchange molecular dynamics to map folding free energy surfaces, identify folding intermediates, and quantify folding/unfolding rates for peptides of varying length and motif.
- Construct Markov state models (MSMs): Build kinetic models from simulation trajectories to capture the distribution of folding pathways, transition rates, and the likelihood of misfolded or off-pathway states.
- Integrate time-resolved single-molecule experiments: Employ force-clamp and force-ramp protocols to measure unfolding and refolding rates, characterize intermediate states, and probe the reversibility of mechanical transitions.
- Combine folding and mechanical data: Analyze how folding kinetics and pathway heterogeneity correlate with mechanical observables ( $F_{\text{max}}$ , unfolding energy, hysteresis), and whether fast-folding or highly cooperative motifs confer enhanced mechanical stability.

Such dynamic analyses will help determine whether the mechanical crossover is preceded or modulated by a corresponding kinetic crossover.

Hypothesis C: A Kinetic Crossover Precedes the Mechanical Crossover, with  $\beta$ -Sheets Overtaking  $\alpha$ -Helices in Folding Speed at Intermediate Lengths. This hypothesis posits that as peptide length increases, the folding kinetics of  $\beta$ -sheet motifs accelerate relative to those of  $\alpha$ -helices, potentially due to cooperative strand pairing or reduced entropic barriers. If true, this would suggest that mechanical and kinetic crossovers are linked, and that engineering fast-folding  $\beta$ -sheet peptides could shift the mechanical advantage to shorter lengths. Experimental validation could involve temperature-jump or stopped-flow folding assays, combined with mechanical testing of the same peptide variants.

- Dynamics matter: Folding and unfolding kinetics can strongly influence mechanical behavior and variability.
- Advanced modeling required: Enhanced-sampling MD and MSMs are critical for mapping complex kinetic landscapes.
- Kinetic-mechanical link: A kinetic crossover may precede or shape the mechanical crossover, offering new levers for design.
- Integrated experiments: Time-resolved single-molecule studies can directly probe the interplay of folding and mechanics.

## 5.4 Advancing Computational and Statistical Methodologies

While the present pipeline offers robust, high-throughput in silico screening, it is constrained by the use of coarse-grained, native-biased models, static folding assessment, and relatively simple statistical analyses. These limitations restrict the ability to capture non-native interactions, sequence-specific effects, and the full diversity of folding and mechanical behaviors.

To overcome these constraints, future efforts should:

- Incorporate hybrid potentials: Develop simulation frameworks that combine Go-like native bias with physics-based non-native interactions, enabling the capture of misfolding, aggregation, and sequencedependent effects.
- Leverage machine learning for sequence design: Implement active-learning or Bayesian optimization approaches to iteratively sample sequence space, focusing computational resources on peptides with high predicted mechanical contrast or novel motifs.
- Adopt advanced statistical models: Utilize Bayesian hierarchical modeling to pool information across sequence classes, lengths, and motifs, providing shrinkage estimates that mitigate sample attrition and enhance inference robustness.
- Automate and parallelize experimental workflows: Integrate high-throughput synthesis, folding characterization, and force measurement platforms (e.g., DNA-origami force clamps, magnetic tweezers arrays) to generate large, statistically representative datasets.
- Standardize data formats and provenance tracking: Develop open, interoperable data standards and version-controlled pipelines to ensure reproducibility, facilitate meta-analyses, and enable community-wide benchmarking.

These methodological advances will not only improve the accuracy and generalizability of peptide mechanics predictions, but also support the systematic discovery of new sequence-structure-property relationships

- Current models are limited: Coarse-grained, static approaches miss key sequence and structural effects
- Hybrid and ML-driven methods: Combining physics-based and data-driven models can accelerate and refine discovery.
- Statistical rigor: Advanced inference techniques are essential for robust, generalizable conclusions.
- High-throughput integration: Automated experimental and computational pipelines will enable larger, more diverse studies.

##### 5.5 Translational and Evolutionary Implications

The ability to rationally tune peptide mechanical properties via length and secondary-structure bias has profound implications for the design of advanced biomaterials and synthetic systems. For example:

- Self-assembling hydrogels: Engineering peptides with tailored force resistance could yield hydrogels with programmable stiffness, toughness, and responsiveness for tissue engineering or drug delivery.
- Mechanically gated biosensors: Incorporating force-sensitive peptides into molecular circuits or cellular scaffolds could enable real-time monitoring or actuation in response to mechanical cues.
- Nanomechanical devices: Designing peptides that switch mechanical properties at defined lengths or in response to environmental triggers could underpin molecular switches, actuators, or load-bearing nanostructures.
- Force-reporting or force-dissipating tags: Embedding robust, short peptides as mechanical modules within larger proteins or synthetic polymers could enhance resilience or provide built-in stress sensors.

Beyond immediate translational applications, these findings invite deeper investigation into the evolutionary logic of protein domain architectures. Comparative genomics and ancestral sequence reconstruction could reveal whether natural proteins exploit length-dependent mechanical crossovers to optimize function under mechanical stress. Integration with proteome-scale biomechanics, molecular evolution, and systems biology can elucidate how mechanical constraints have shaped protein diversity and organismal adaptation. Furthermore, extending the methodologies to nucleic acids, intrinsically disordered proteins, or synthetic polymers could uncover universal principles of macromolecular mechanics.

- Enabling new biomaterials: Tunable peptide mechanics can drive innovation in hydrogels, sensors, and nanodevices.
- Synthetic biology integration: Mechanically responsive peptides offer new tools for cellular engineering.
- Evolutionary insight: Length-dependent mechanics may have shaped natural protein evolution and diversity.
- Cross-domain relevance: The design principles and methodologies are adaptable to other biomolecular systems.

##### 5.6 Synthesis of Future Directions and Strategic Priorities

In summary, the elucidation of a length-dependent mechanical crossover in short peptides is a starting point for a comprehensive research agenda. The next steps must address:

- 1. Mechanistic dissection at atomic and molecular levels, integrating simulation and experiment.
- 2. Expansion of structural and sequence diversity to test the universality and boundaries of the crossover principle.
- 3. Dynamic and kinetic modeling to capture folding-unfolding pathways and nonequilibrium effects.
- 4. Methodological innovation to enhance predictive accuracy, throughput, and reproducibility.
- 5. Translational and interdisciplinary integration to realize the full potential of tunable peptide mechanics in science and technology.

Pursuing these priorities will transform the current phenomenological insight into a predictive, mechanistically grounded, and broadly applicable framework for rational biomolecular engineering.

- Mechanistic, methodological, and translational advances are all needed for field progress.
- Strategic integration of simulation, experiment, and data science will accelerate discovery.
- The research agenda is inherently interdisciplinary, with impact across biophysics, materials science, and evolutionary biology.

Ultimately, the outlined future work aspires to move from descriptive discovery to predictive control of peptide mechanics, enabling the design of next-generation biomaterials, molecular devices, and biological systems with unprecedented mechanical performance. By bridging molecular insight, computational power, experimental innovation, and application-driven goals, this research agenda will help realize the promise of rational, mechanics-informed biomolecular engineering.

## Length-Dependent Stability Crossover Between Helix- and Sheet-Rich De Novo Proteins

##### AI-generated document

##### $\mathbf 1$ Introduction

Proteins are fundamental biological macromolecules whose structural integrity underpins their diverse biochemical functions. The three-dimensional fold of a protein is primarily determined by its amino acid sequence, which in turn dictates the formation of characteristic **secondary structure elements**:  $\alpha$ -helices  $(H)$ ,  $\beta$ -sheets  $(E)$ , and less regular motifs such as turns and coils. These motifs are stabilized by distinct patterns of hydrogen bonding and side-chain interactions, and their relative abundance within a polypeptide sequence—termed secondary structure content—is a major determinant of the protein's overall stability and folding kinetics.

Understanding how secondary structure content influences protein stability is of critical importance to fields as varied as protein engineering, synthetic biology, and biomedical research. Rational design of stable proteins enables the creation of novel enzymes, therapeutics, and nanomaterials, while elucidating stability determinants also informs our understanding of protein misfolding diseases. However, despite decades of research, the precise relationship between the content of  $\alpha$ -helices,  $\beta$ -sheets, and their combinations (mixed folds) and the resulting thermodynamic stability remains incompletely resolved, particularly in the context of varying polypeptide chain length.

- Protein stability is intricately linked to the content and arrangement of  $\alpha$ -helices and  $\beta$ -sheets.
- Secondary structure content is a critical design parameter for synthetic proteins and therapeutics.
- The impact of protein length on stability-structure correlations is underexplored and of high practical relevance.

A central challenge in dissecting the stability-structure relationship lies in the entanglement of sequence, length, and fold type in natural proteins. Evolutionary processes have optimized natural sequences for function, often coupling specific amino acid patterns, chain lengths, and secondary structure distributions in ways that confound causal analysis. Additionally, the physical requirements for forming stable  $\alpha$ -helices (which rely on local  $i \to i+4$  hydrogen bonds) differ fundamentally from those for  $\beta$ -sheets (which require non-local, often long-range, strand pairing). This raises the question: How does protein length  $\emph{modulate the intrinsic stability conferred by different secondary structure motifs, and is there a critical length of the two different components.}$ at which the stability landscape changes?

Experimentally addressing this question is non-trivial. Natural protein datasets are limited by evolutionary bias, and systematic mutational or length-variation studies are laborious and costly. Computationally, simulating the folding and stability of large numbers of proteins across a range of lengths and structures has only recently become feasible, thanks to advances in protein structure prediction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. However, even in silico, generating unbiased, length-controlled, secondary-structure-biased protein libraries requires careful methodological design.

In this study, we hypothesize that  $\alpha$ -helix-rich proteins exhibit stability that is largely independent of chain length, owing to the local nature of helix-stabilizing interactions. In contrast,  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins require a minimum chain length to achieve sufficient strand pairing and hydrophobic core formation for stability; below this threshold, they are intrinsically less stable. We further posit that mixed  $(\alpha/\beta)$  proteins will display a non-monotonic, U-shaped dependence of stability on length, reflecting the competing requirements of local and non-local contacts. These hypotheses are grounded in established biophysical principles and supported by qualitative trends observed in natural protein folds, but have not been quantitatively tested in a controlled, synthetic setting.

- Key challenge: Decoupling the effects of length and secondary structure in natural proteins is confounded by evolutionary constraints.
- Biophysical rationale:  $\alpha$ -helices are stabilized by local contacts, while  $\beta$ -sheets require long-range interactions.
- Hypothesis: There exists a critical length threshold for  $\beta$ -sheet stability, with mixed folds showing non-linear behavior.

To overcome the limitations of natural protein datasets, we employ a fully synthetic, in silico approach that systematically varies both chain length and secondary structure bias. Using state-of-the-art sequence design algorithms (design\_protein\_from\_CATH), we generate libraries of proteins with prescribed lengths (ranging from 40 to 120 amino acids in 20-residue increments) and targeted secondary structure content (helix-rich, sheet-rich, or mixed). This design enables us to decouple length and structure, providing a unique testbed for probing their interplay without confounding evolutionary or functional selection pressures.

Each designed sequence is computationally folded and subjected to molecular dynamics relaxation (MD\_protein), with maximum root mean square deviation (max RMSD) from the folded structure serving as an operational proxy for thermodynamic stability. Secondary structure content is quantified post-relaxation, allowing for rigorous correlation and regression analyses across the entire dataset. Statistical approaches—including median and interquartile range analysis, ANOVA, and correlation coefficient mapping—will be applied to discern trends and test the central hypothesis.

We anticipate observing (i) a flat stability profile for helix-rich proteins across the tested length range, (ii) a marked improvement in stability for sheet-rich proteins as length increases, with a critical crossover point, and (iii) a non-monotonic trend for mixed folds. Success will be evaluated based on the statistical significance and reproducibility of these patterns. Beyond hypothesis testing, the results are expected to inform rational design rules for synthetic proteins—enabling the tailored engineering of stability as a function of length and secondary structure content—and to provide new insights into the physical underpinnings of protein folding.

- · Synthetic approach: Enables systematic, unbiased exploration of length-structure-stability relationships.
- Robust workflow: Combines sequence design, folding, MD simulation, and quantitative analysis.
- Broader implications: Results will inform protein design principles and advance understanding of folding thermodynamics.

#### $\overline{2}$ Methods

The methodology of this study was meticulously crafted to systematically investigate the interplay between protein chain length, secondary structure bias, and thermodynamic stability in de novo protein designs. Recognizing the confounding influence of evolutionary selection in natural proteins, we adopted a fully in silico, synthetic approach that enabled the independent manipulation of key variables. This strategy allowed for the decoupling of sequence length and secondary structure content, thereby providing a controlled and unbiased framework to elucidate the causal relationships underlying protein stability.

- Objective: Disentangle the effects of length and secondary structure on protein stability using a synthetic, unbiased design.
- Philosophy: Avoid evolutionary bias by employing systematic, in silico protein generation and analysis
- Approach: Modular, automated workflow ensures reproducibility, transparency, and scalability.

#### 2.1 Design Rationale and Parameter Selection

The experimental design targeted a comprehensive exploration of the stability landscape across both length and secondary structure axes. Protein lengths were chosen to span from 40 to 120 amino acids in increments of  $20 (L = 40, 60, 80, 100, 120)$ , reflecting a range that encompasses both small, single-domain folds and larger, more complex architectures. This interval was selected to balance biological relevance, computational tractability, and the constraints imposed by the available design tools, which are less reliable for shorter sequences  $(L < 30)$ .

For each length, three secondary structure biases were targeted:  $\alpha$ -helix-rich,  $\beta$ -sheet-rich, and mixed  $\alpha/\beta$ , corresponding to CATH codes "1", "2", and "3" respectively. These classes were chosen to represent the major fold types observed in natural proteins and to test specific hypotheses regarding the length-dependence of stability in different structural contexts.

The initial sample size was set to 10 sequences per (length, class) cell, as dictated by computational efficiency constraints and the need for statistical power. Through iterative rounds, under-represented groups were expanded to 20 samples where necessary, ensuring balanced representation and robust statistical analvsis.

- Length Range:  $40-120$  amino acids, in steps of 20, captures diverse fold sizes.
- Structural Classes:  $\alpha$ -helix,  $\beta$ -sheet, and mixed designs address key hypotheses.
- Sample Size: Minimum of 10, expanded to 20 for statistical robustness in critical groups.

## 2.2 Synthetic Sequence Generation

Protein sequences were generated using the environment-supplied Python function design\_protein\_from\_CATH(length, cath), which constructs amino acid sequences with a stochastic bias toward the specified secondary structure class. The function parameters include:

- length: Integer specifying the desired number of residues  $(40 \le L \le 120)$ .
- cath: String indicating the structural bias ("1" for  $\alpha$ -helix, "2" for  $\beta$ -sheet, "3" for mixed).

The output is a single-sequence string in FASTA format, containing only standard amino acid characters. Notably, the function's fidelity to the requested bias is probabilistic, particularly for short  $\beta$ -sheet designs, necessitating post hoc validation (see Section 2.5).

Each generated sequence was assigned a unique sample identifier (sample\_id) encoding its length, design class, and index (e.g., 60\_alpha\_1). To ensure traceability, all sequence metadata were stored in a structured JSON file (results\_1.json) immediately upon creation.

- Tool: design\_protein\_from\_CATH enables controlled, stochastic sequence generation.
- Parameterization: Length and structural bias explicitly specified for each sample.
- Traceability: Unique identifiers and metadata ensure reproducibility and auditability.

##### Three-Dimensional Structure Prediction 2.3

Each designed sequence was folded into a three-dimensional structure using the function fold\_protein(sequence, name). This function accepts the amino acid sequence and a user-defined name for the output structure, returning the filename of the generated PDB file. The folding methodology (ab initio or template-based) is abstracted by the environment, but is assumed to yield the lowest-energy, physically plausible conformation for each sequence.

All folded structures were saved in PDB format, with filenames reflecting the sample identifier (e.g., 60\_alpha\_1\_fold.pdb). To maintain organizational clarity and facilitate downstream processing, each structure was stored in a dedicated directory (sim\_{sample\_id}).

- · Folding: Each sequence is converted to a 3D structure using fold\_protein.
- · Output: PDB files are named and organized for easy retrieval and analysis.
- Automation: Directory structure supports parallel and reproducible workflows.

## 2.4 Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Stability Assessment

To assess thermodynamic stability, each folded structure underwent molecular dynamics (MD) relaxation using the function MD\_protein(input\_pdb, work\_path). This function simulates the protein in explicit solvent, allowing for conformational relaxation and the sampling of dynamic fluctuations.

The primary output metrics were:

- max.rmsd: The maximum  $C_{\alpha}$  root mean square deviation (RMSD, in  $\hat{A}$ ) observed during the simulation. relative to the initial folded structure. This metric serves as a proxy for structural stability, with lower values indicating greater resistance to unfolding or large-scale rearrangement.
- sec\_structure: A dictionary reporting the percentage of residues adopting each secondary structure type post-relaxation, using standard DSSP one-letter codes (H for  $\alpha$ -helix, E for  $\beta$ -strand, etc.).

All simulation data were stored in sample-specific directories, and the extracted metrics were appended to the corresponding entry in results\_1.json.

- MD Simulation: Provides a dynamic, physically realistic assessment of stability.
- Stability Metric: Maximum RMSD quantifies global structural deviations.
- Secondary Structure: Post-MD analysis validates intended structural bias.

##### Bias Validation and Quality Control $2.5\,$

Given the stochastic nature of sequence design, not all generated proteins conformed to their intended secondary structure bias after folding and MD relaxation. To ensure dataset integrity, a strict post hoc validation was applied:

- $\alpha$ -helix-rich: Samples were required to exhibit >50% of residues in the H ( $\alpha$ -helix) state.
- $\beta$ -sheet-rich: Samples were required to exhibit >50% of residues in the E ( $\beta$ -strand) state.
- Mixed: No quantitative threshold was imposed; all samples were accepted.

Samples failing these criteria were excluded from further analysis. For each (length, class) group, the process was repeated until the desired number of passed-bias samples was obtained, or until a maximum of 15 design attempts per missing sample was reached. This approach ensured that the final dataset accurately reflected the intended experimental design.

- Bias Enforcement: Strict thresholds guarantee fidelity to intended structural class.
- Iterative Design: Multiple attempts mitigate the stochasticity of sequence generation.
- Dataset Integrity: Only validated samples are included in downstream analysis.

#### 2.6 Iterative Rounds and Dataset Balancing

The study was conducted in a series of iterative rounds, each designed to progressively fill gaps, address sample imbalances, and enhance statistical power in critical groups. The workflow for each round was as  $follows$ 

- 1. Round 1: Initial sampling aimed for 10 passed-bias samples per (length, class) cell. Groups with insufficient samples were targeted for additional design attempts.
- 2. Follow-up Round 1: Sample gaps were filled to ensure that every group had at least 10 passed-bias samples, with up to 15 attempts per missing sample.
- 3. Follow-up Round 2: Short-length  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  groups ( $L = 40,60$ ) were expanded to 20 samples each, motivated by the need to clarify unexpected stability trends.
- 4. Follow-up Round 3: All groups at  $L = 80, 100, 120$  were boosted to 20 samples per class to strengthen statistical power and equalize group sizes.
- 5. Follow-up Round 4: The remaining mixed groups at  $L = 40,60$  were expanded to 20 samples each, completing a fully balanced  $5 \times 3$  design matrix with 20 samples per cell.

After each round, the sample counts were recomputed, and only deficient groups were targeted in subsequent rounds. The process was fully automated, with helper functions tracking sample indices and group sizes to prevent oversampling and ensure unique identifiers.

- Iterative Rounds: Systematic approach ensures balanced, statistically robust sampling.
- Automated Tracking: Dynamic monitoring of group sizes prevents duplication and bias.
- Scalability: Workflow supports expansion or adaptation to additional variables if needed.

## 2.7 Data Management, Automation, and Reproducibility

All data generated during the study were organized and stored to facilitate reproducibility, traceability, and efficient downstream analysis. Key aspects include:

- Per-sample metadata: Each sample's sequence, structural class, folding and MD results, and validation status were stored as a dictionary in results\_1.json.
- · Aggregate statistics: Medians, interquartile ranges, Pearson correlations, and Kruskal-Wallis test results were recomputed after each round and saved in final\_results\_1.json.
- Directory structure: All simulation outputs were stored in uniquely named directories (sim\_{sample\_id}), avoiding file collisions and supporting parallel execution.
- Progress logs: Time-stamped notes documenting each round's objectives, strategies, and achievements were appended to notes\_1.txt for transparency and auditability.
- Automation: The entire workflow was encapsulated in modular Python scripts, with clear separation between design, folding, simulation, validation, and aggregation steps. Helper functions (next\_index, sample\_passes\_bias) ensured robust sample tracking and error handling.

All scripts and intermediate files are archived and available for reproduction upon request, requiring only the specified environment-supplied functions and standard Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scipy).

- Comprehensive Data Management: All stages are logged and organized for full reproducibility.
- Automation: Modular scripts minimize human error and streamline large-scale sampling.
- Transparency: Detailed notes and structured files support audit and peer review.

## 2.8 Statistical Preprocessing and Quality Control

To enable rigorous downstream analysis, a suite of statistical descriptors was computed and stored for each (length, class) group:

- Central tendency and dispersion: The median and interquartile range  $(IQR)$  of maximum RMSD values were calculated to summarize stability distributions and identify outliers.
- Correlational analysis: Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between  $\beta$ -sheet percentage and maximum RMSD, as well as between  $\Delta SS = E - H$  and RMSD, to quantify the relationship between secondary structure content and stability.
- Non-parametric group comparison: The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare the distributions of maximum RMSD across the three structural classes at each length, providing a robust assessment of between-group differences without assuming normality.

All metrics were recalculated after each sampling round and stored in final\_results\_1.json. These precomputed statistics formed the basis for hypothesis testing and trend analysis in the Results section.

- Statistical Rigor: Multiple descriptors capture both central trends and group differences.
- Preprocessing: All statistics are computed and stored prior to interpretation.
- Foundation for Results: Enables robust, reproducible hypothesis testing in later sections.

#### 2.9 Challenges, Limitations, and Mitigation Strategies

Several challenges emerged during the study:

- Design fidelity: The stochastic nature of design\_protein\_from\_CATH led to variable success rates in achieving the intended structural bias, especially for short  $\beta$ -sheet designs. This was mitigated by iterative resampling, strict post hoc validation, and capping the number of design attempts per missing sample.
- Computational resource management: The need for multiple rounds and large sample sizes increased computational demands. Automation, parallelization, and efficient directory management were employed to minimize resource contention and human error.
- Metric selection: While maximum RMSD is a widely used and interpretable proxy for stability, it does not capture all aspects of folding thermodynamics. The study acknowledges this limitation and suggests that future work could incorporate more nuanced metrics (e.g., free energy calculations).
- Automation robustness: Extensive error handling, unique sample identifiers, and progress logging were implemented to ensure workflow resilience in the face of tool failures or unexpected output.

- Design Variability: Iterative sampling and strict validation ensure dataset quality.
- Resource Management: Automation and parallelization address computational challenges.
- Metric Limitations: RMSD is a practical but incomplete measure of stability.
- Workflow Resilience: Robust tracking and logging safeguard against data loss and errors.

The approach ensures that observed trends can be robustly attributed to the variables of interest, free from confounding evolutionary or procedural biases.

##### 3 Results

**Comment:** This opening paragraph revisits the study's central motivation, linking the Results to the core hypotheses and orienting the reader to the structure and aims of the section.

A central challenge in protein biophysics is to disentangle how chain length and secondary structure content jointly determine the thermodynamic stability of folded proteins. While natural proteins provide only a confounded sampling of length and fold, our *de novo* design and simulation campaign—comprising 300 bias-validated, single-domain proteins spanning five lengths (40-120 amino acids) and three structural classes ( $\alpha$ -helix-rich,  $\beta$ -sheet-rich, and mixed  $\alpha/\beta$ )—enables a systematic, unbiased investigation. The Results section is organized to: (i) map global stability trends as a function of length and secondary structure, (ii) dissect the interplay between composition and stability, (iii) interrogate the mechanistic underpinnings of observed patterns, and (iv) critically assess the statistical robustness and limitations of the findings.

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a roadmap for the section, clarifying the logic and sequence of analyses.

We begin by presenting aggregate trends in simulated stability (maximum RMSD) across the full length-structure matrix, supported by regression and non-parametric statistics. Subsequent subsections analyze the continuous relationship between secondary-structure bias and stability, the role of  $\beta$ -strand content as a lengthdependent stabilizer, and the heterogeneity within design classes. Finally, we synthesize these findings relative to the original hypotheses and discuss methodological limitations.

##### $3.1$ Global Stability as a Function of Length and Secondary Structure Class

Comment: This paragraph motivates the focus on maximum RMSD as a stability proxy and introduces the key visual (Figure 1) and table (Table 1) summarizing median and interquartile RMSD values.

A primary goal was to determine whether protein stability—as quantified by the maximum backbone rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) sampled during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations—exhibits systematic variation with respect to chain length and secondary-structure class. Figure 1 displays the median and interquartile range (IQR) of maximum RMSD for each (length, class) combination, with quadratic regression fits overlaid. Table 1 provides the corresponding numerical values for direct comparison.

Comment: This paragraph provides a fine-grained, data-driven description of the trends in Figure 1 and Table 1, highlighting both expected and unexpected patterns.

Three principal trends emerge from the data:

- 1.  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins display the lowest and most length-independent RMSD values. Across the entire 40–120 amino acid range, the median RMSD for  $\beta$ -rich proteins remains tightly clustered between 2.59 and 2.86 Å, with IQRs consistently below 1.7 Å. This finding is notable, as it contradicts the initial hypothesis that  $\beta$ -sheet stability would be strongly length-dependent, instead suggesting intrinsic rigidity of  $\beta$ -sheet architectures even at minimal chain lengths.
- 2.  $\alpha$ -helix-rich proteins exhibit a shallow, non-monotonic dependence on length. The median RMSD for  $\alpha$  designs increases from 2.86 Å at 40 aa to a peak of 4.00 Å at 60 aa, then declines to  $2.44-2.80$  Å at 100-120 aa. The IQR spans up to 3.1 Å at 60 aa, indicating a transient decrease in stability at intermediate lengths.
- 3. Mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins are distinctly less stable at short lengths but converge towards the pure classes with increasing length. At 40-60 aa, median RMSD values for mixed proteins are 3.54–3.85 Å, with broad IQRs  $(2.7-5.2 \text{ Å})$ , indicating both lower stability and greater heterogeneity. However, as length increases, the median RMSD for mixed proteins drops to  $2.82-3.04$  Å at 100-120 aa, approaching the stability of the  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  classes.

**Comment:** This paragraph interprets the quadratic regression fits, discusses the explanatory power  $({\bf R}^2),$  and contextualizes the implications for each structural class.

Quadratic regression models (see Table 2) quantitatively capture these class-specific trends. The mixed class exhibits the strongest length dependence, with a quadratic fit explaining 61% of the variance ( $R^2$  = 0.61), while the  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  classes show more modest fits ( $R^2 = 0.32$  and 0.12, respectively). The negative quadratic coefficient for all classes suggests that stability initially decreases (RMSD rises) with increasing length before improving at longer lengths, but this effect is most pronounced for the mixed class. The comparatively flat profile for  $\beta$  proteins  $(a = -5.3 \times 10^{-5})$  underscores their length-insensitive stability.

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a mechanistic rationale for the observed trends, linking them to physical models of helix, sheet, and mixed fold stabilization.

These class-specific trends can be rationalized in light of established biophysical principles. The relative length-independence of  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins is consistent with the notion that once a minimal  $\beta$ -sheet motif is established, additional residues primarily extend the sheet without introducing destabilizing edge effects, at least within the 40–120 aa window. In contrast,  $\alpha$ -helical bundles rely on local  $i \to i + 4$  hydrogen bonds for stability, but also require optimal helix-helix packing, which may be compromised at intermediate lengths where the number of helices or their arrangement is suboptimal, leading to the observed transient instability

Image /page/52/Figure/0 description: The image is a scatter plot titled "Median stability vs length with best fits". The x-axis is labeled "Protein length (aa)" and ranges from 40 to 120. The y-axis is labeled "Median max RMSD (A)" and ranges from 2.0 to 5.5. There are three sets of data plotted: alpha, beta, and mixed. Each data set has a scatter plot with error bars and a best fit line. The alpha data is shown in blue, the beta data is shown in green, and the mixed data is shown in purple. The alpha fit has an R^2 value of 0.32, the beta fit has an R^2 value of 0.12, and the mixed fit has an R^2 value of 0.61.

Figure 1: Length-stability profiles for helix-rich, sheet-rich and mixed proteins. Median maximum RMSD (symbols) with IQR error bars; quadratic fits are shown as dashed lines (fit parameters in Table 2).  $\beta$ sheet-rich proteins are the most stable and display minimal length dependence, whereas mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins are least stable at short lengths but converge towards the pure classes at longer chain lengths.

at 60 aa. Mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins, by their nature, involve competition between local helix formation and non-local  $\beta$ -strand pairing, creating topological frustration at short lengths where the polypeptide cannot simultaneously satisfy both structural motifs. As length increases, additional residues permit better burial of hydrophobic interfaces and capping of vulnerable edges, resulting in a pronounced gain in stability.

- Class-specific length dependence:  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins are inherently stable and nearly lengthindependent; mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins are markedly less stable at short lengths but converge to the pure classes at longer lengths.
- Non-monotonic  $\alpha$  trend:  $\alpha$ -helix-rich proteins show a shallow, non-monotonic RMSD profile, with a stability minimum at intermediate lengths.
- Regression analysis: Quadratic fits reveal that length explains most variance in mixed proteins  $(R^2 = 0.61)$ , but much less in  $\alpha$  or  $\beta$  classes.
- Mechanistic insight: Topological frustration in mixed proteins and the cooperative nature of  $\beta$ sheet hydrogen bonding underpin the observed trends.

##### $3.2\,$ The Composition-Stability Landscape: Triangular "Frustration Zone"

**Comment:** This paragraph motivates the need to move beyond discrete structural classes by analyzing secondary-structure bias  $(\Delta SS)$  as a continuous variable, and introduces Figure 2.

While structural classes provide a useful coarse-graining, the actual secondary-structure content of designed proteins spans a continuum. To dissect how compositional bias shapes stability, we plotted maximal RMSD against  $\Delta SS = \%E - \%H$  (the difference between  $\beta$ -strand and  $\alpha$ -helix content) for all 300 designs (Figure 2). Points are colored by chain length, providing a three-dimensional view of the composition-length-stability landscape.

| 2*Length (aa) | 2*Class  | Max RMSD (A) |        |        |

Comment: This paragraph provides a detailed reading of the triangular "frustration zone" and how length modulates stability across the composition spectrum.

The resulting scatterplot reveals a striking triangular envelope. Proteins with extreme  $\alpha$ - or  $\beta$ -rich compositions ( $\Delta SS \le -50$  or  $\Delta SS \ge +50$ ) cluster at low RMSD ( $\le 5$  Å), regardless of length, indicating that strong secondary-structure bias is inherently stabilizing. In contrast, the maximal RMSD dispersion (ranging from 2 to 16 Å) is observed near  $\Delta SS \approx 0$ , corresponding to balanced  $\alpha/\beta$  content. This "frustration" zone" is characterized by a high density of unstable outliers, particularly among short and intermediatelength proteins. Notably, as chain length increases (color gradient from purple to yellow), the upper RMSD boundary narrows, especially in the  $\beta$ -rich regime: long chains (> 90 aa) with high  $\beta$  content are almost uniformly stable (RMSD  $< 5$  Å), whereas short chains scatter up to 9 Å.

Comment: This paragraph unpacks the mechanistic origins of the frustration zone and discusses implications for protein design.

Mechanistically, the broad RMSD range at  $\Delta SS \approx 0$  can be attributed to topological frustration: mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  topologies create competing folding nuclei, increasing conformational entropy and the likelihood of misfolded or partially unfolded states. This is consistent with the "frustration" concept in protein folding theory, wherein conflicting structural requirements impede the formation of a unique, cooperative core. The narrowing of the envelope at high  $|\Delta SS|$  reflects the dominance of cooperative local interactions—either helix-helix or strand-strand-that stabilize the structure regardless of length. For protein design, these results imply that short, balanced  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins are intrinsically unstable unless stabilized by additional features (e.g., disulfide bonds, metal ions, or engineered capping motifs), whereas highly biased sequences are robust even at minimal lengths.

Image /page/54/Figure/0 description: The image is a scatter plot titled "Secondary-structure bias vs stability". The x-axis is labeled "ΔSS = E% - H%" and ranges from -100 to 75. The y-axis is labeled "max RMSD (Å)" and ranges from 0 to 16. The plot contains many data points, each represented by a circle. The color of each circle varies according to a color bar on the right side of the plot, which is labeled "Length (aa)" and ranges from 40 to 120.

Figure 2: Relationship between secondary-structure bias and simulated stability across protein **lengths.** Each point represents a designed protein; the x-axis shows  $\Delta SS = \%E - \%H$  (difference between  $\beta$ -strand and  $\alpha$ -helix content), the y-axis the maximum backbone RMSD (Å) during MD simulation, and color encodes chain length (40-120 aa). The data reveal a triangular envelope: RMSD dispersion peaks at balanced secondary-structure ( $\Delta SS \approx 0$ ), but narrows markedly toward extreme  $\alpha$ - or  $\beta$ -rich compositions.

- Triangular "frustration zone": Proteins with balanced  $\alpha/\beta$  content display the broadest and highest instability, especially at short lengths.
- Extreme bias is stabilizing: Both  $\alpha$ -rich and  $\beta$ -rich sequences are stable across all tested lengths.
- Length modulates  $\beta$ -rich stability: Long  $\beta$ -rich proteins are uniformly stable, while short ones are more variable.
- Design implication: Avoiding balanced secondary-structure content is advisable for ultra-short synthetic proteins.

#### 3.3 Length-Dependent Role of $\beta$ -Strand Content

Comment: This paragraph motivates the use of Pearson correlation to quantify the association between  $\beta$ -strand content and stability at each length, and introduces the relevant figure and table.

To quantitatively assess how the stabilizing effect of  $\beta$ -strand content depends on chain length, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between  $\%$   $\beta$  and maximum RMSD for each length group (Table 3, Figure 3). Negative r values indicate that increasing  $\beta$  content correlates with increased stability (lower RMSD), while positive values indicate the opposite.

Comment: This paragraph provides an in-depth interpretation of the observed oscillatory correlation pattern and its mechanistic implications.

The correlation between  $\beta$ -strand content and stability exhibits a non-monotonic, oscillatory pattern. At 40 aa,  $r = -0.08$  (weakly negative); this negative association strengthens at 60 aa ( $r = -0.29$ ) and peaks at 80 aa ( $r = -0.36$ ), indicating that at intermediate lengths, increasing  $\beta$  content most strongly stabilizes the fold. However, at 100 aa, the correlation inverts to a weakly positive value  $(r = +0.12)$ , suggesting that beyond a critical length, additional  $\beta$  content may actually destabilize the protein, possibly due to the emergence of multi-sheet topologies or unsatisfied edge strands. At 120 aa, the correlation reverts to a modestly negative value ( $r = -0.18$ ), implying a partial restoration of the stabilizing effect. This oscillation suggests the existence of discrete length regimes with qualitatively different structural constraints.

Image /page/55/Figure/1 description: The image is a plot of the length dependence of beta-content/stability correlation. The x-axis is labeled "Protein length (aa)" and ranges from 40 to 120. The y-axis is labeled "Pearson r (8% vs RMSD)" and ranges from -0.3 to 0.1. There is a dashed horizontal line at y=0. The plot shows a line connecting the following points: (40, -0.08), (60, -0.29), (80, -0.36), (100, 0.12), and (120, -0.18).

Figure 3: Length dependence of the correlation between  $\beta$ -strand content and protein stability. Pearson correlation coefficient  $(r)$  between  $\%$   $\beta$  and maximum RMSD for each length group. Negative values indicate a stabilizing effect of  $\beta$ -content; a sign flip at 100 as suggests a critical transition in structural regime.

| Length $(aa)$ | $r_{\beta,\textrm{RMSD}}$ |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| 40            | $-0.081$                  |
| 60            | $-0.289$                  |
| 80            | $-0.363$                  |
| 100           | $+0.121$                  |
| 120           | $-0.181$                  |

Table 3: Pearson correlation coefficients between  $\beta$ -strand percentage and maximum RMSD at each length.

Comment: This paragraph provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed oscillatory correlation, referencing specific structural models.

We propose that this pattern reflects the interplay between cooperative  $\beta$ -sheet hydrogen bonding and the exposure of edge strands. At short to intermediate lengths (40–80 aa), increasing  $\beta$  content extends a single, cooperative sheet, maximizing hydrogen bonding and stability. Around 100 aa, the sheet may become large enough to introduce additional edge strands or to split into multiple patches, increasing the risk of fraying and partial unfolding, thereby inverting the stabilizing effect. At even longer lengths (120 aa), the availability of extra residues may permit the formation of tertiary clamps or additional secondary-structure elements (e.g., helices or loops) that cap vulnerable edges and restore stability.

- Non-monotonic correlation: The stabilizing effect of  $\beta$ -strand content peaks at intermediate lengths, inverts at 100 aa, and partially recovers at 120 aa.
- Critical size threshold: The sign flip in correlation suggests a transition between single-sheet and multi-sheet/topologically complex regimes.
- Mechanistic insight: Cooperative hydrogen bonding and edge-strand exposure compete to determine stability as length increases.
- Design implication: Careful control of  $\beta$ -strand placement and edge capping is essential for designing stable long  $\beta$ -rich proteins.

#### 3.4 Heterogeneity of Secondary-Structure Content Within Design Classes

Comment: This paragraph motivates the need to examine the actual secondary-structure content distributions within each design class, given the stochastic nature of sequence generation.

Despite explicit biasing during sequence design, the realized secondary-structure content of the  $\alpha$ ,  $\beta$ , and mixed classes exhibits substantial overlap, as shown in Figure 4. Box-and-whisker plots compare the distribution of  $\%$   $\alpha$ -helix (left) and  $\%$   $\beta$ -sheet (right) content for each class, revealing both the efficacy and limitations of the design protocol.

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a detailed analysis of the observed structural distributions and their implications for class-based analyses.

For  $\alpha$ -rich proteins, helix content is tightly clustered at high values (median  $\approx 80\%$ , IQR 70–85%), and  $\beta$  content is essentially zero, with only a few low outliers (< 5%). In contrast,  $\beta$ -rich proteins show a broader distribution: helix content is near zero for most members (median  $\approx 0\%$ ), but with a long righthand tail reaching up to 45%, while  $\beta$ -sheet content centers around 35-40% but spans up to 70%. Mixed proteins occupy an intermediate regime, with helix content spanning  $0-95\%$  (median  $\approx 45\%$ ) and sheet content ranging from 0 to 55% (median  $\approx 18\%$ ). The wide variances and heavy tails indicate pronounced compositional heterogeneity, particularly in the mixed and  $\beta$  classes.

Image /page/56/Figure/9 description: The image contains two boxplots. The first boxplot is titled "Helix content (%)" and shows the distribution of helix content for alpha, beta, and mixed structures. The y-axis is labeled "Percentage" and ranges from 0 to 100. The alpha structure has a median helix content of around 80%, with some outliers below 60%. The beta structure has a median helix content of around 15%, with some outliers above 60%. The mixed structure has a median helix content of around 45%. The second boxplot is titled "B-sheet content (%)" and shows the distribution of beta-sheet content for alpha, beta, and mixed structures. The alpha structure has a median beta-sheet content of around 0%, with some outliers above 20%. The beta structure has a median beta-sheet content of around 35%, with some outliers above 60%. The mixed structure has a median beta-sheet content of around 20%.

Figure 4: Distribution of helix (left) and sheet (right) content across structural classes. Box-plots show the interquartile range (IQR, box), median (orange line), whiskers  $(1.5 \times IQR)$ , and outliers (points).  $\alpha$ -rich proteins are highly helical,  $\beta$ -rich proteins show a long helix tail, and mixed proteins span a broad range of both contents.

**Comment:** This paragraph discusses the implications of within-class heterogeneity for interpreting stability trends and for future modeling strategies.

This compositional heterogeneity has important implications. Residual helices in  $\beta$ -rich proteins may serve as nucleation centers, mitigating the expected length dependence and enhancing stability. Conversely, mixed proteins with high helix content but moderate  $\beta$  content may behave more like  $\alpha$ -helical bundles, blurring the distinction between classes. These findings argue against treating secondary-structure classes as discrete categories in predictive modeling and underscore the need for continuous, composition-aware approaches.

- Substantial heterogeneity: Actual secondary-structure content within each class is highly variable, especially for  $\beta$  and mixed proteins.
- Class overlap: Some  $\beta$ -rich proteins contain significant helical content, and mixed proteins span the full helix range.
- Implication for modeling: Categorical class labels are insufficient; quantitative secondarystructure fractions should be used for predictive models.
- Design consideration: Residual helices in  $\beta$  proteins may enhance stability and should be considered in design strategies.

## 3.5 Impact of Coil/Unstructured Content on Stability Across Classes

**Comment:** This paragraph motivates the analysis of coil (unstructured) content as a determinant of stability and introduces the corresponding figure.

Beyond helix and sheet content, the fraction of residues in coil or unstructured conformations is a critical determinant of protein stability. Figure 5 plots maximum RMSD against coil content for all proteins, colored by design class, to elucidate how disorder impacts stability across different secondary-structure frameworks.

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a nuanced analysis of the class-specific impact of coil content on stability, referencing thresholds and outlier behavior.

 $\alpha$ -rich proteins cluster at low coil percentages (5–25%) and low RMSD (1.5–6 Å), indicating resilience to modest disorder. In contrast,  $\beta$ -rich proteins span a much broader coil range (5-70%) and display a fan-shaped pattern: as coil content increases, both the mean and variance of RMSD rise, with several highinstability outliers (RMSD > 10 Å) appearing beyond  $\sim 35\%$  coil. Mixed proteins occupy an intermediate window (5–35% coil, RMSD  $\langle 8 \text{ Å} \rangle$ ). Notably, there is an apparent "coil threshold" ( $\sim 30-35\%$ ) beyond which only  $\beta$  proteins are represented and stability declines sharply.

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a mechanistic account of why coil content is more destabilizing in  $\beta$ -rich proteins and discusses implications for synthetic design.

The pronounced destabilization of  $\beta$ -rich proteins with increasing coil content can be attributed to the disruption of long-range  $\beta$ -strand hydrogen bonding: unstructured segments interrupt strand registry, create edge exposure, and increase the likelihood of partial unfolding. In contrast,  $\alpha$ -helical bundles, stabilized by local hydrogen bonds, are more tolerant of modest coil fractions. For protein design, these findings highlight the importance of minimizing coil content, especially in  $\beta$ -rich architectures, or incorporating stabilizing features such as edge capping or strategic helix insertion.

- Coil content is destabilizing: High coil fractions disproportionately destabilize  $\beta$ -rich proteins, leading to large RMSD excursions.
- Class-specific resilience:  $\alpha$ -rich proteins are robust to moderate disorder; mixed proteins are intermediate.
- Critical coil threshold: Instability in  $\beta$  proteins rises sharply above  $\sim 30\%$  coil.
- Design implication: Minimizing coil content is essential for stable  $\beta$ -rich designs;  $\alpha$ -rich proteins are more forgiving.

Image /page/58/Figure/0 description: The image is a scatter plot titled "Influence of coil content on stability". The x-axis is labeled "Coil / unstructured content (%)" and ranges from 0 to 70. The y-axis is labeled "max RMSD (A)" and ranges from 0 to 16. There are three sets of data points plotted on the graph, each represented by a different color: red for "alpha", blue for "beta", and green for "mixed". The data points are scattered across the plot, showing the relationship between coil content and stability for each category.

##### $\bf 3.6$ Statistical Significance of Class and Length Effects

**Comment:** This paragraph presents non-parametric group comparisons and discusses the implications for statistical significance and effect size.

To assess the statistical significance of observed differences in stability among structural classes at each length, we performed Kruskal-Wallis tests (Table 4). At four of five lengths (40, 60, 100, 120 aa), class differences are not statistically significant  $(p > 0.22)$ , indicating that within-group variance often exceeds between-group differences. However, at 80 aa, the p-value approaches significance  $(p = 0.058)$ , coinciding with the peak negative correlation between  $\beta$  content and stability and the maximum instability of mixed proteins. This suggests that length-specific effects are subtle and may require larger sample sizes or more refined class definitions to achieve robust statistical power.

| Length (aa) | $\chi^2$ statistic | <i>p</i> -value |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 40          | 2.97               | 0.226           |
| 60          | 2.99               | 0.225           |
| 80          | 5.68               | 0.058           |
| 100         | 0.69               | 0.709           |
| 120         | 2.83               | 0.243           |

Table 4: Kruskal-Wallis comparison of RMSD distributions among the three structural classes at each length.

- Class differences are subtle: Most class-by-length differences in stability are not statistically significant at  $n = 20$  per group.
- Peak effect at 80 aa: The strongest trend  $(p = 0.058)$  coincides with the maximum instability of mixed proteins.
- Implication for power: Larger sample sizes or continuous class definitions may be needed to robustly detect length-dependent effects.

## 3.7 Synthesis Relative to the Original Hypotheses

**Comment:** This paragraph directly addresses each original hypothesis, referencing specific data and analyses.

A critical goal was to test three biophysically grounded hypotheses:

- $H_0$ : "a-helix-rich proteins are stable irrespective of length." This is only partially supported: while  $\alpha$ -rich proteins are relatively stable across the tested range, there is a notable dip in stability at 60 aa (median RMSD 4.00 Å), indicating a non-monotonic dependence likely linked to suboptimal helix-helix packing at intermediate lengths.
- H<sub> $\beta$ </sub>: " $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins require a minimum length for stability." This is largely contradicted: *8*-rich proteins are the most stable class even at 40 aa (median RMSD 2.59 Å), and display minimal length dependence, suggesting that cooperative  $\beta$ -sheet formation is robust even in small domains.
- $H_{mix}$ : "Mixed  $(\alpha/\beta)$  proteins show a U-shaped length dependence." This is strongly supported: mixed proteins are least stable at short lengths, but their stability improves markedly beyond 80–100 aa, producing the predicted U-shaped profile.
- $\alpha$  hypothesis: Supported with caveats; stability is not strictly length-independent.
- $\beta$  hypothesis: Contradicted;  $\beta$ -sheet stability is robust even at minimal lengths.
- Mixed hypothesis: Supported; mixed proteins are uniquely sensitive to length, with a pronounced U-shaped stability profile.
- Refinement: The interplay between length and secondary-structure bias is more nuanced than originally anticipated, with composition-specific effects dominating.

##### $3.8$ Limitations and Future Directions

Comment: This paragraph provides an in-depth discussion of methodological limitations, their impact on interpretation, and recommendations for future research.

Several limitations of the present study warrant discussion. First, the use of maximum RMSD as a proxy for stability, while practical and widely adopted, does not capture the full thermodynamic or kinetic landscape of folding; rare excursions or local unfolding events may inflate RMSD without reflecting true thermodynamic instability. Second, the stochastic nature of the sequence design process resulted in broad and overlapping distributions of secondary-structure content within each class (see Figure 4), complicating strict comparisons and potentially diluting class-specific effects. Third, the sample size  $(n = 20 \text{ per group})$ provides moderate but not exceptional statistical power, as evidenced by the marginal significance of some class differences (Table 4). Fourth, the MD protocols and force fields used, while state-of-the-art, have not been benchmarked against experimental folding data for these synthetic sequences; thus, absolute RMSD values should be interpreted as qualitative rather than quantitative measures of stability. Finally, the analysis was restricted to single-domain, 40-120 aa proteins, and may not generalize to multi-domain or larger architectures.

Future work should address these limitations by incorporating more nuanced stability metrics (e.g., freeenergy calculations, folding kinetics), employing tighter sequence design constraints to reduce within-class heterogeneity, expanding sample sizes, and validating computational predictions with experimental folding measurements. Additionally, extending the analysis to finer-grained topological subclasses (e.g., Rossmannlike, TIM-barrel fragments) and integrating sequence-derived frustration metrics could further refine the understanding of length-composition-stability relationships.

- Metric limitations: Maximum RMSD is an incomplete proxy for thermodynamic stability.
- Design heterogeneity: Broad compositional overlap within classes complicates interpretation.
- Sample size: Moderate  $n$  limits statistical power for subtle effects.
- Generality: Findings may not extend to multi-domain or very large proteins.
- Future work: Experimental validation and more refined modeling are needed to confirm and generalize these results.

**Comment:** This final paragraph synthesizes the main findings and their implications for the field.

In summary, this systematic in silico study reveals that the relationship between protein length, secondarystructure content, and stability is highly class- and composition-dependent.  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins are robustly stable across a wide length range, contrary to classical expectations, while mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins exhibit a pronounced length threshold for stability, likely reflecting topological frustration. These insights refine fundamental design principles for synthetic proteins and highlight the necessity of length- and composition-aware modeling in protein engineering.

##### $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ Conclusion

Comment: This paragraph provides a comprehensive summary of the research motivation, the scientific gap addressed, and the unique methodological approach employed in the study.

The stability of folded proteins, determined by the interplay between their amino acid sequence, secondary structure content, and chain length, remains a central question in structural biology and protein engineering. Natural protein datasets are limited by evolutionary bias, making it challenging to disentangle the causal effects of sequence length and secondary structure arrangement on thermodynamic stability. In response to this challenge, the present study employed a fully synthetic, in silico approach—systematically generating. folding, and simulating 300 de novo designed proteins—to rigorously interrogate how the content of  $\alpha$ -helices  $(H)$ ,  $\beta$ -sheets  $(E)$ , and mixed motifs modulate stability across a wide range of chain lengths (40–120 residues). By leveraging state-of-the-art sequence design, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and robust statistical analysis, we sought to decouple the effects of secondary structure bias and length, thereby providing new insights into the fundamental determinants of protein stability.

- Synthetic, unbiased dataset: Overcomes evolutionary confounding by systematically varying both length and secondary structure content.
- Comprehensive computational workflow: Integrates automated sequence design, folding, MD simulation, and validation.
- Central research question: How do  $\alpha$ -helix,  $\beta$ -sheet, and mixed secondary structure contents, together with chain length, shape protein stability?

**Comment:** This paragraph presents the main results in a structured, data-driven manner, referencing key figures, tables, and statistical analyses to support each conclusion.

The systematic exploration of the length-structure-stability landscape yielded several critical findings:

 $\bullet$   $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins exhibit robust, length-independent stability: Contrary to canonical

expectations, proteins designed to be  $\beta$ -rich maintained low median RMSD values (2.59–2.86 Å) across all tested lengths (Table 1), with minimal variance ( $IQR < 1.7$  Å). Quadratic regression confirmed a flat stability profile ( $R^2 = 0.12$ ), suggesting that cooperative  $\beta$ -sheet formation can stabilize even the shortest single-domain proteins in this synthetic context.

- $\alpha$ -helix-rich proteins display a non-monotonic, shallow dependence on length: Median RMSD values for  $\alpha$ -rich proteins ranged from 2.44 to 4.00 Å, with a notable stability minimum at 60 residues (Table 1; Figure 1). This dip likely reflects suboptimal helix-helix packing or incomplete bundle formation at intermediate lengths, as supported by the negative quadratic coefficient ( $a =$  $-2.69 \times 10^{-4}$ ) and moderate fit  $(R^2 = 0.32)$ .
- Mixed  $(\alpha/\beta)$  proteins demonstrate a pronounced U-shaped stability profile as a function of length: At short lengths (40–60 residues), mixed proteins were the least stable (median RMSD) 3.54–3.85 Å; IQR up to 5.2 Å), but their stability improved markedly with increasing length, converging towards the pure classes at  $100-120$  residues (Table 1). Quadratic regression explained 61% of the variance  $(R^2 = 0.61)$ , highlighting the strong length dependence unique to mixed architectures.
- The "frustration zone" at balanced secondary structure content ( $\Delta SS \approx 0$ ) is characterized by maximal instability and heterogeneity: As visualized in Figure 2, proteins with nearly equal  $\alpha$ -helix and  $\beta$ -sheet content exhibited the broadest RMSD dispersion (up to 16 Å), especially at short lengths. In contrast, extreme  $\alpha$ - or  $\beta$ -rich compositions were uniformly stable, indicating that strong secondary structure bias mitigates topological frustration.
- The stabilizing effect of  $\beta$ -strand content is length-dependent and oscillatory: Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the negative association between  $\beta$ -content and RMSD peaked at 80 residues ( $r = -0.36$ ), inverted at 100 residues ( $r = +0.12$ ), and partially recovered at 120 residues  $(r = -0.18)$  (Table 3; Figure 3). This pattern suggests the existence of discrete structural regimes, likely driven by the balance between cooperative hydrogen bonding and edge-strand exposure.
- Coil (unstructured) content is a critical destabilizer, especially in  $\beta$ -rich proteins: As shown in Figure 5,  $\beta$ -rich proteins with coil fractions above  $\sim 30{\text -}35\%$  displayed a sharp increase in RMSD (up to > 10 Å), whereas  $\alpha$ -rich proteins remained relatively stable even with moderate coil content. This underscores the importance of minimizing disorder, particularly in sheet-rich architectures.
- Length-independent  $\beta$ -sheet stability: Short  $\beta$ -rich proteins can be intrinsically stable if designed appropriately.
- Non-monotonic  $\alpha$ -helix trend: Intermediate-length  $\alpha$  bundles may be less stable due to packing inefficiencies.
- Mixed protein instability at short lengths: Topological frustration is most acute in short, compositionally balanced proteins.
- Composition is a dominant determinant: Strong secondary structure bias is more predictive of stability than length alone.

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a mechanistic synthesis, interpreting the findings in the context of protein folding theory and structural biology.

The observed trends can be rationalized by established biophysical principles.  $\beta$ -sheet architectures benefit from the formation of extensive hydrogen-bond networks, which, once nucleated, can stabilize even relatively short polypeptides by minimizing edge exposure and maximizing cooperative interactions. The unexpected length-independence of  $\beta$ -rich protein stability in this synthetic dataset may reflect the absence of evolutionary constraints that typically select against small, aggregation-prone  $\beta$  motifs in nature. In contrast,  $\alpha$ -helical bundles rely on local  $i \to i+4$  hydrogen bonding, but their global stability is sensitive to the number and packing of helices—explaining the transient instability at intermediate lengths where optimal

bundle formation may be frustrated. Mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins, by combining both local and long-range structural requirements, are especially susceptible to topological frustration, particularly at short lengths where the polypeptide chain cannot simultaneously satisfy the competing demands of helix and sheet formation. The triangular "frustration zone" observed at balanced  $\alpha/\beta$  content is consistent with the theoretical framework of energetic frustration in protein folding, wherein conflicting structural preferences impede the formation of a unique, cooperative core.

- Mechanistic insight: Cooperative hydrogen bonding in  $\beta$ -sheets and local stabilization in  $\alpha$ -helices underpin the observed stability patterns.
- Topological frustration: Mixed architectures are uniquely sensitive to competing structural demands, especially at short lengths.
- Design context: Synthetic proteins can overcome natural size constraints, revealing new regimes of stability.

Comment: This paragraph situates the findings within the broader landscape of protein science, emphasizing their implications for rational design and synthetic biology.

The scientific impact of these findings is multifold. First, the demonstration that  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins can be stably designed at short chain lengths challenges longstanding paradigms in protein engineering and suggests new avenues for creating compact, robust  $\beta$ -sheet scaffolds. Second, the identification of a critical instability regime in short, mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins provides a quantitative basis for the empirical difficulties often encountered in designing stable enzymes or receptors with complex topologies. Third, the compositional rules elucidated here—favoring strong secondary structure bias and minimizing coil content—offer practical guidelines for the rational design of synthetic proteins, therapeutic biologics, and nanomaterials. By systematically mapping the length-composition-stability space, this study contributes foundational knowledge that will inform the next generation of computational protein design algorithms and experimental synthetic biology efforts.

- Paradigm shift: Size constraints for stable  $\beta$ -sheet proteins can be circumvented by synthetic design.
- Design heuristics: Strong secondary structure bias and low coil content are key to stability, especially in short proteins.
- Broader utility: Findings are directly applicable to engineering stable enzymes, scaffolds, and nanomaterials.

Comment: This paragraph critically examines the limitations of the study, their impact on the interpretation of results, and caveats for future research.

Despite its strengths, the study has notable limitations. The use of maximum RMSD as a proxy for thermodynamic stability, while practical and widely used, does not capture all aspects of the folding energy landscape or kinetic stability; rare excursions or local unfolding events may inflate RMSD without indicating global instability. The stochastic nature of the sequence design process led to substantial compositional heterogeneity within each structural class, as evidenced by the broad and overlapping distributions of secondary structure content (Figure 4), potentially diluting class-specific effects and complicating categorical comparisons. The moderate sample size  $(n = 20$  per group) provided reasonable statistical power but was insufficient to resolve subtle class-by-length interactions, as indicated by non-significant Kruskal-Wallis tests at most lengths (Table 4). Additionally, the reliance on computational force fields and MD protocols, while stateof-the-art, introduces uncertainties regarding the quantitative accuracy of stability predictions, especially in the absence of experimental validation. Finally, the focus on single-domain proteins  $(40-120 \text{ residues})$  limits the generalizability of the findings to larger, multi-domain, or intrinsically disordered proteins.

- Proxy limitations: Maximum RMSD does not fully capture thermodynamic or kinetic stability.
- Compositional overlap: Class heterogeneity may obscure or dilute true effects.
- Computational dependence: Force field and MD limitations constrain quantitative interpretation.
- Scope: Results are most relevant to single-domain, globular proteins.

Comment: This paragraph synthesizes the study's contributions and proposes future research directions to address remaining gaps.

Looking forward, several avenues merit exploration. Incorporating more nuanced stability metrics—such as free energy calculations, folding kinetics, or experimental melting temperatures—would provide a more complete understanding of the stability landscape. Tightening sequence design constraints to reduce withinclass heterogeneity, increasing sample sizes, and extending the analysis to multi-domain or larger proteins would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the conclusions. Experimental validation, including the synthesis and biophysical characterization of representative designs, is essential to confirm computational predictions and refine the underlying models. Finally, integrating frustration metrics, topological analysis, and machine learning approaches may further elucidate the complex grammar governing sequence-structure-stability relationships in proteins.

- Expand metrics: Use free energy and kinetic measures for deeper stability insights.
- Reduce heterogeneity: Optimize sequence design for tighter compositional control.
- Experimental validation: Synthesize and test designs to benchmark computational predictions.
- Integrate advanced analytics: Leverage machine learning and topological metrics for future stud-

**Comment:** This final paragraph summarizes the overarching contribution of the study and its implications for the future of protein design and structural biology.

In summary, this work delivers a comprehensive, quantitative map of how protein length and secondary structure composition jointly determine stability in synthetic, single-domain proteins. By challenging entrenched assumptions—such as the necessity of long chains for stable  $\beta$ -sheet formation—and providing actionable design heuristics, the study advances both the theoretical understanding and practical capabilities of protein engineering. The integration of systematic synthetic design, high-fidelity simulation, and rigorous statistical analysis sets a new standard for investigating the physical principles underlying protein folding, offering a robust foundation for future innovations in computational and experimental protein science.

- Comprehensive mapping: Length and secondary structure content are now quantitatively linked to protein stability.
- Refined understanding: Classical assumptions about  $\beta$ -sheet size and mixed fold instability are revised.
- Methodological advance: Synthetic, decoupled, and reproducible datasets enable new scientific discovery.
- Foundation for innovation: The study paves the way for next-generation protein design and folding research.

#### **Future Work** $\bf{5}$

**Comment:** This paragraph sets the stage for an in-depth and structured exploration of future research directions, emphasizing the need for rigor, innovation, and integration across experimental, computational, and methodological domains.

The systematic and unbiased in silico investigation presented in this study has significantly advanced our understanding of how protein chain length and secondary structure content—specifically  $\alpha$ -helices,  $\beta$ -sheets, and mixed motifs—govern protein stability. However, the findings also illuminate a landscape replete with unresolved questions, methodological challenges, and opportunities for transformative advances. This Future Work section is therefore organized to: (i) critically identify open scientific questions and limitations, (ii) propose detailed experimental and computational strategies for further exploration, (iii) articulate new, testable hypotheses inspired by observed phenomena, (iv) recommend methodological and tooling innovations—including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative models, and (v) contextualize these efforts within broader scientific and translational agendas. Each subsection concludes with a "Key Takeaways" box to distill the most salient insights.

##### $5.1$ Open Questions and Limitations

Comment: This paragraph provides a comprehensive analysis of the most pressing unresolved questions, linking them to specific observations and biophysical principles.

Despite the robustness of the present results, several critical questions remain. First, the observed lengthindependent stability of  $\beta$ -sheet-rich proteins contradicts canonical expectations from both experimental and theoretical studies, which often posit a minimal size threshold for stable  $\beta$ -sheet formation due to edgestrand exposure and aggregation propensity. This raises the question: Are the synthetic  $\beta$ -rich proteins truly thermodynamically stable, or do the simulation protocols and force fields mask subtle instabilities and kinetic *traps?* Second, the pronounced instability and heterogeneity of mixed  $(\alpha/\beta)$  proteins at short lengths, forming a so-called "frustration zone," suggests the existence of topological or energetic bottlenecks—yet the molecular determinants of this phenomenon remain ill-defined. Third, the use of maximum RMSD as a stability proxy, while practical, may overlook important aspects of folding cooperativity, kinetic stability, and partial unfolding events. Fourth, the stochasticity and compositional overlap inherent in the sequence design process complicate the attribution of observed trends to discrete structural classes, calling for more refined design and validation strategies. Finally, the broader relevance of these findings to multi-domain proteins, intrinsically disordered regions, and real-world cellular environments remains to be established.

- Length-independence of  $\beta$ -sheet stability is unexpected and requires deeper mechanistic analysis.
- The "frustration zone" in mixed proteins points to unresolved topological and energetic challenges.
- Current stability metrics (e.g., RMSD) may not capture the full folding landscape.
- Sequence design stochasticity and class overlap limit interpretability and generalizability.
- Extension to larger, multi-domain, and cellular contexts remains an open challenge.

##### $5.2$ **Experimental Validation and Expansion**

**Comment:** This paragraph offers a comprehensive plan for in vitro experimental validation, specifying the rationale for each technique, expected outcomes, and how these will address current limitations.

To rigorously validate the computational predictions and address the limitations of simulation-based proxies, a multi-tiered experimental program is essential. Representative proteins should be selected from each (length, secondary structure class) group, prioritizing both extreme and intermediate stability cases as predicted by MD (e.g., the most and least stable  $\beta$ -rich,  $\alpha$ -rich, and mixed designs at each length).

Primary characterization should begin with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to quantify secondary structure content and confirm the intended fold. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and chemical denaturation (using urea or guanidinium hydrochloride) will provide direct measurements of thermodynamic stability, including melting temperature  $(T_m)$  and unfolding free energy  $(\Delta G_{unf})$ .

Kinetic analyses using stopped-flow fluorescence or temperature-jump experiments will elucidate folding and unfolding rates, enabling comparison with kinetic barriers inferred from simulation. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) coupled with NMR or mass spectrometry will map local flexibility and identify regions of persistent disorder or fraying, particularly in coil-rich or edge-exposed  $\beta$ -sheet regions.

Structural validation should employ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and, where feasible, highresolution methods such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to confirm global topology and oligomeric state. For short proteins or those with ambiguous folds, solution NMR can provide residue-level structural detail.

Controls and comparative benchmarks should include natural proteins of similar length and fold, as well as designed variants with targeted mutations (e.g., edge-capping helices, coil insertions, or disulfide bonds) to directly test the impact of specific sequence features on stability.

- In vitro validation is essential to confirm computational predictions and reveal hidden instabilities.
- A multi-modal approach—combining CD, DSC, HDX, SAXS, and high-resolution methods—provides a comprehensive stability and structure profile.
- Benchmarking against natural proteins and designed variants enables mechanistic dissection of stability determinants.
- Experimental data will inform refinement of computational models and design algorithms.

## 5.3 Advanced Computational and Theoretical Approaches

Comment: This paragraph details enhanced simulation protocols, free-energy calculations, and theoretical frameworks, explaining their relevance and integration with experimental efforts.

To complement and expand upon experimental work, future computational studies should employ advanced sampling and modeling techniques that transcend the limitations of conventional MD and RMSDbased metrics.

Enhanced sampling methods such as replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), metadynamics, and umbrella sampling can be used to generate free-energy surfaces, revealing folding pathways, intermediate states, and energy barriers that are inaccessible to standard MD. Markov state models (MSMs) constructed from these simulations will provide quantitative estimates of folding kinetics and population distributions among metastable states.

Coarse-grained and multi-scale models (e.g., AWSEM, OpenMM-Martini, or CABS-flex) enable exploration of longer timescales and larger systems, facilitating the study of multi-domain proteins, aggregation propensity, and the effects of crowding or confinement.

Alchemical mutation scans—systematically introducing point mutations, coil insertions, or edgecapping motifs—can be coupled with free-energy perturbation (FEP) or thermodynamic integration to quantify the energetic impact of specific sequence or structural features on stability.

Integration with experimental data can be achieved through Bayesian inference or machine-learningbased model calibration, using measured  $T_m$ ,  $\Delta G_{\text{unf}}$ , and HDX profiles to refine force fields and validate simulation outputs.

Theoretical developments should focus on extending frustration-based models, quantifying the energetic cost of topological conflicts in mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  folds, and developing analytic expressions for the scaling of stability with length and secondary structure content.

- Enhanced sampling and free-energy methods provide a more complete picture of the folding landscape.
- · Coarse-grained models enable exploration of larger, more complex systems and environmental effects.
- Alchemical mutation and edge-capping scans allow systematic dissection of stability determinants.
- Theoretical advances will yield predictive, mechanistically grounded models of protein stability.

#### 5.4 Development of New Hypotheses

**Comment:** This paragraph elaborates on new hypotheses, situating them within the broader context of protein folding and design, and outlining experimental/computational strategies for their evaluation.

Building on the discoveries and anomalies observed in this study, several novel hypotheses emerge that warrant rigorous investigation:

- Aromatic Network Hypothesis  $(H_{\text{aromatic}}):$  Background: Aromatic residues are known to mediate stabilizing  $\pi-\pi$  and cation- $\pi$  interactions in protein cores. Hypothesis: Above a critical density of aromatic residues, the formation of a percolating  $\pi$ -network can compensate for the lack of extensive secondary structure, conferring stability even in short or compositionally ambiguous proteins. Prediction: Designed proteins with high aromatic content but low  $\alpha$  or  $\beta$  bias will display unexpectedly high thermodynamic stability, as measured by  $T_m$  and  $\Delta G_{\text{unf}}$ , and will show distinct spectroscopic signatures (e.g., UV absorbance, fluorescence).
- Edge-Capping Hypothesis ( $H_{\text{edge-capping}}$ ): Background: Edge strands in  $\beta$ -sheets are prone to fraying and aggregation due to unsatisfied hydrogen bonds. Hypothesis: Introduction of short  $\alpha$ -helical or loop capping motifs at  $\beta$ -sheet edges will systematically reduce instability and abolish the observed oscillatory length dependence in  $\beta$ -rich proteins. Prediction: Comparative stability assays and MD simulations of capped versus uncapped  $\beta$ -sheet designs will reveal increased stability, reduced coil content, and fewer high-RMSD outliers in capped variants.
- Entropy Buffer Hypothesis ( $H_{\text{entropy-buffer}}$ ): Background: Flexible coil or loop regions can act as entropic spacers, modulating folding pathways and frustration. Hypothesis: Incorporation of optimally sized coil segments at strategic positions in mixed  $\alpha/\beta$  proteins can buffer topological frustration, facilitating cooperative folding and enhancing stability. *Prediction:* Systematic variation of coil length and placement will reveal a non-monotonic relationship with stability, with an optimal buffer length scaling as  $\sqrt{L}$ .
- Non-Canonical Residue Hypothesis  $(H_{\text{non-canonical}}):$  Background: Non-standard amino acids (e.g., N-methyl, D-amino acids, fluorinated residues) can alter local backbone propensity and hydrogen bonding. Hypothesis: Selective incorporation of non-canonical residues will differentially stabilize  $\alpha$ -helices versus  $\beta$ -sheets, shifting the position and severity of the "frustration zone" in the composition-stability landscape. *Prediction:* Experimental and computational analysis will reveal altered secondary structure distributions, folding kinetics, and stability profiles in non-canonical variants.

- New hypotheses target aromatic networks, edge capping, entropy buffering, and noncanonical residue effects.
- Each hypothesis is grounded in biophysical principles and is experimentally and computationally testable.
- Testing these ideas may reveal unanticipated mechanisms of protein stabilization.
- Results could expand the design space for novel synthetic proteins and biomaterials.

##### Methodological and Tooling Innovations $5.5$

**Comment:** This paragraph provides a detailed blueprint for the next generation of computational and analytical tools, including their intended use cases and anticipated impact.

To overcome current methodological bottlenecks and enable more precise, scalable, and interpretable studies, several new tools and functions should be developed:

- · design\_protein\_with\_constraints(length, cath, ss\_targets, coil\_max): An extension of the current design\_protein\_from\_CATH function, this tool would iteratively design sequences until quantitative secondary structure targets (e.g.,  $> 70\%$   $\alpha$ -helix,  $< 10\%$  coil) are met, as validated by predicted or folded structures. This would reduce compositional overlap and improve class fidelity.
- predict\_folding\_kinetics(pdb): Leveraging accelerated MD and machine-learning-trained potentials, this tool would estimate folding and unfolding rate constants, transition-state ensembles, and folding pathways for arbitrary PDB structures, providing kinetic as well as thermodynamic insight.
- $\bullet$  edge\_strand\_identifier(pdb): This analytical function would scan folded structures to identify exposed  $\beta$ -sheet edge strands, quantify their solvent accessibility, and suggest sequence or structural modifications (e.g., capping motifs, point mutations) to mitigate instability.
- $\bullet$  stability meta\_analyser(database): A meta-analytical platform that aggregates stability data (RMSD,  $T_m$ ,  $\Delta G_{\text{unf}}$ , kinetic rates) from multiple sources, enabling cross-study comparisons, trend discovery, and hypothesis generation via interactive visualization and statistical modeling.
- Automated Design-Simulation-Analysis Pipelines: Modular, reproducible workflows that integrate sequence design, structure prediction, MD simulation, and statistical analysis, supporting highthroughput exploration of length-composition-stability space.

These tools should be designed for interoperability, transparency, and extensibility, with open-source code and standardized data formats to facilitate community adoption and collaborative development.

- New tools will enable more precise, targeted, and scalable exploration of protein stability.
- · Constraint-based sequence design will reduce class heterogeneity and improve interpretability.
- Kinetic and edge-strand analysis tools will provide mechanistic and actionable insights.
- Meta-analysis platforms will accelerate discovery and hypothesis generation across studies.

#### 5.6 Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Generative Models

**Comment:** This paragraph explores the integration of AI and machine learning into protein design, simulation, and analysis, highlighting both the opportunities and technical challenges.

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) and deep generative architectures, presents unprecedented opportunities for advancing protein science. Future research should harness AI in multiple, synergistic ways:

- Generative Sequence and Structure Design: LLMs fine-tuned on protein sequence-structure-stability datasets can generate novel sequences conditioned on user-specified constraints (e.g., length, secondary structure fractions, coil content, presence of motifs). Diffusion models and graph neural networks (GNNs) can propose 3D backbones or full atomistic structures with tailored folding landscapes.
- Automated Multi-Agent Pipelines: LLM-driven multi-agent systems can autonomously orchestrate the design-fold-simulate-analyze cycle, dynamically adjusting sampling strategies based on realtime feedback (e.g., steering sequence generation toward under-explored or high-frustration regions of the stability landscape).
- Predictive Modeling and Transfer Learning: Machine learning models trained on aggregated stability and structural data can rapidly predict thermodynamic and kinetic properties, guide experimental prioritization, and identify non-obvious stability determinants through feature attribution and explainable AI techniques.
- Literature Mining and Knowledge Synthesis: LLMs can extract, summarize, and contextualize relevant findings from the vast protein science literature, enabling the integration of experimental and computational knowledge, identification of gaps, and formulation of new research questions.
- Challenges and Considerations: Key technical challenges include ensuring data quality and representativeness, mitigating biases (e.g., over-representation of certain folds or lengths), interpreting black-box model predictions, and integrating AI outputs with mechanistic biophysical understanding.
- AI and generative models can revolutionize protein design, simulation, and analysis.
- LLMs and GNNs enable constraint-driven, creative exploration of sequence-structure space.
- Automated, adaptive multi-agent systems can accelerate discovery and optimize resource allocation.
- Careful integration of AI with mechanistic models and experimental validation is essential for robust progress.

#### 5.7 High-Impact Scientific Questions and Proposed Investigations

**Comment:** This paragraph synthesizes the previous discussions into concrete, high-priority research questions, detailing how each can be addressed in practice.

Drawing from the current study and the preceding analysis, several high-impact scientific questions emerge, each amenable to both experimental and computational investigation:

 $(a)$  In vitro: • What is the true minimal length for stable  $\beta$ -sheet formation, and how do edge-capping motifs alter this threshold?

> *Approach:* Systematically synthesize  $\beta$ -rich proteins of varying lengths (e.g., 30, 40, 50, 60) residues) with and without designed edge-capping helices. Measure stability via DSC, CD, and aggregation propensity via light scattering. Compare to natural  $\beta$ -domains as controls.

• Can topological frustration in short mixed  $(\alpha/\beta)$  proteins be mitigated by engineered entropy buffers or disulfide bonds?

Approach: Introduce flexible coil segments or strategic cysteine pairs into the most unstable mixed designs. Assess effects on folding kinetics, thermodynamic stability, and structural integrity using the methods outlined above.

• How do non-canonical amino acids modulate the stability and folding pathways of synthetic proteins?

Approach: Incorporate N-methyl, D-amino acids, or other modifications at targeted positions. Characterize changes in secondary structure content, stability, and folding cooperativity.

- What are the free-energy landscapes and kinetic barriers associated with  $(b)$  In silico: edge-strand exposure and fraying in  $\beta$ -rich proteins? Approach: Apply umbrella sampling and REMD to representative  $\beta$ -rich designs, quantifying the energetic cost of edge exposure and the effect of capping motifs.
  - How does the stability landscape evolve as a function of length, secondary structure bias, and coil content in large-scale, AI-driven sampling? Approach: Deploy reinforcement learning agents or Bayesian optimization to explore the sequence-structure-stability space, maximizing composite rewards (e.g., low RMSD, high predicted  $T_m$ , minimal coil).
  - Can machine learning models trained on synthetic and natural datasets predict stability outcomes for unseen designs, and what features are most predictive? Approach: Train and validate predictive models, perform feature attribution, and test generalizability across diverse sequence and structure classes.
  - Targeted in vitro and in silico experiments will clarify the limits and mechanisms of protein stability.
  - · Edge-capping, entropy buffering, and non-canonical residues are promising strategies for stability optimization.
  - AI-driven exploration and predictive modeling can accelerate discovery and hypothesis testing.
  - · Integration of experimental and computational results will yield robust, generalizable insights.

##### 5.8 Broader Scientific Integration and Impact

Comment: This paragraph situates the future research within the grand challenges of protein science, biotechnology, and synthetic biology, highlighting translational and interdisciplinary potential.

The research directions outlined above not only address fundamental questions in protein folding and stability but also have far-reaching implications for biotechnology, medicine, and materials science. The ability to design ultra-stable, compact  $\beta$ -sheet scaffolds could revolutionize enzyme engineering, biosensor development, and the creation of novel biomaterials.
