# Organizing OpenAI Custom GPT Projects on GitHub

Organizing multiple Custom GPT projects in a structured way will make collaboration and iteration much easier. Below we break down the components of your Custom GPTs and provide a recommended folder structure, naming conventions, and versioning practices for managing them in a GitHub repository.

## Overview of Custom GPT Components

Each Custom GPT you create consists of several parts that need to be managed:

- **Primary Prompt/Instructions:** The core instructions or system prompt that define the GPT’s behavior and personality. These are provided in the GPT’s configuration (the "instructions" in OpenAI’s builder).
- **Knowledge Base Files:** Any custom data files you upload to extend the GPT’s knowledge (PDFs, JSON, TXT, etc.). These allow the GPT to retrieve information beyond the base model’s training. In your case, this includes knowledge graphs in JSON-LD format.
- **Custom Actions (APIs):** Definitions for any external tool/API integrations the GPT can call. OpenAI’s Custom GPTs use an OpenAPI-like schema (in JSON or YAML) to describe these actions. Essentially, you provide a JSON specification that tells the GPT how to call an external API (endpoints, parameters, etc.), enabling it to perform tasks or fetch data beyond its built-in capabilities.
- **Custom Action Code (if applicable):** If you had to write backend code for a custom API (for example, a small web service or script that the GPT’s action calls), that code needs to be maintained as well. (Often, though, custom actions call existing third-party APIs, so you might not have much custom code aside from the API spec.)

## Single vs. Multiple Repositories

For managing ~5–10 Custom GPTs, it’s usually simplest to use **one GitHub repository** that contains all your GPT projects, rather than a separate repo for each. A single repository offers several advantages:

- **Single Source of Truth:** All GPT configurations are in one place, making it easy to search and ensure consistency.
- **Easier Collaboration:** Team members can open one repository to find or update any GPT. Issues and pull requests can be tracked in one project (you can label them by GPT name if needed).
- **Reuse of Assets:** If some GPTs share common code or data (for example, a shared utility script or common knowledge file), a monorepo makes it easier to factor those out into a shared location.

Using one repo is feasible as long as the total number of GPTs is manageable (dozens rather than hundreds). If in the future your GPT projects grow dramatically or belong to very different teams, you could revisit using multiple repos. For now, a single collaborative repository is optimal for 5–10 GPTs.

## Recommended Repository Structure

```plaintext

├── README.md                    # Overview of all GPTs, how to use the repo
├── GPT_FinanceAssistant/        # Example GPT project directory (use descriptive names)
│   ├── README.md                # Documentation specific to this GPT (purpose, usage)

│   └── assets/                  # (Optional) any other assets (logos, examples, etc.)

│   └── ...
└── .github/                     # CI workflows, issue templates, etc., if needed
```

## Naming Conventions and Discoverability

- **GPT Folder Names:** Use descriptive names or titles of the GPT. Ideally, mirror the name you’ve given it in the OpenAI interface. For example, if your GPT is called "Finance Assistant GPT" in ChatGPT, you might name the folder `GPT_FinanceAssistant` or `FinanceAssistantGPT`.
- **Prompt Files:** `prompt.md` or `instructions.md` are obvious choices.
- **Knowledge Files:** Name by content (e.g., `acme_products.jsonld`, `network_diagrams.pdf`).
- **Action Schemas:** Name by the service or functionality (e.g., `calendar_api.yaml`, `notion_api.json`).
- **Version Tags:** Use Git tags/releases for versioning rather than folder names.

## Versioning and Iteration

- Use Git commits to track changes to prompts, configs, and knowledge files.
- Tag or release versions (e.g., `FinanceAssistant-v2`) for milestones.
- Use branches for major revisions if collaborating.
- Maintain a changelog in each GPT’s README if desired.

## Collaboration Best Practices

- Document each GPT’s purpose, setup, and usage in its README.
- Use pull requests for changes; review diffs carefully for prompt/data changes.
- Use GitHub issues with labels per GPT to track tasks and bugs.
- Use consistent formats for prompts, knowledge files, and schemas.
- Keep API keys and sensitive data out of the repo.

## Planning for Growth and Automation

- Consider adding CI checks (lint JSON/YAML files, validate schemas).
- For large numbers of GPTs, group by category or split into multiple repos later.
- Archive deprecated GPTs to keep the repo clean.

By adopting a clear folder-per-GPT structure and leveraging Git for version control, you’ll make it much easier to manage multiple Custom GPTs as your collection grows. This structure supports frequent iteration, collaboration, and reuse, while keeping you ready for future automation or CI/CD integration.
